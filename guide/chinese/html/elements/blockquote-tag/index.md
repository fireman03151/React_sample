## Blockquote标签

### 目的

HTML `<blockquote>`元素打破了周围内容的引用。这允许读者清楚地看到报价作为归于其原始作者的材料。

### 用法

就像“H”标签向读取器发送信息一样重要信息时，块引用会提醒读者他们正在读取的信息来自外部来源。 `<blockquote>`标记可以包括引用源的URL可以使用cite属性给出，而源的文本表示可以使用`<cite>`元素给出。

### 例

```html

<blockquote cite="https://www.cnet.com/news/tim-cook-maintains-steve-jobs-beatles-business-model/"> 
 “My model for business is The Beatles. They were four guys who kept each other's kind of negative tendencies in check. 
 They balanced each other and the total was greater than the sum of the parts. 
 That's how I see business: great things in business are never done by one person, they're done by a team of people.” 
 </blockquote> 
 <cite>Steve Jobs</cite> 
```
