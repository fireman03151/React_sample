## Case Studies

The Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University published a large collection of case studies to help expose practicing software developers and students to the various types of ethical dilemmas they may face.

Cases:

* [**Privacy, Technology, and School Shootings**](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/privacy/case-study-on-online-privacy/) - Schools are increasingly monitoring students' online activity.

* [**Disclosing Software Vulnerabilities**](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/business-ethics/resources/the-vulnerability-disclosure-debate/)

* [**Shipping Defective Products to Customers**](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/more/engineering-ethics/engineering-ethics-cases/to-ship-or-not-to-ship/)

* [**Time-Sharing Space**](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/more/engineering-ethics/engineering-ethics-cases/time-sharing-space/) - An intern suspects a fellow intern is being condescending due to her gender.

* [**Copyright Concerns**](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/more/engineering-ethics/engineering-ethics-cases/copyright-concerns/) - An employee develops software with some code that they had previously written while employed at another company.

* [**Unintended Effects**](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/more/engineering-ethics/engineering-ethics-cases/unintended-effects/) - A manager believes his company is providing the wrong form of technology to an in-need community.

* [**Insurmountable Differences**](https://www.scu.edu/ethics/focus-areas/more/engineering-ethics/engineering-ethics-cases/insurmountable-differences/) - Responding to racially motivated remarks in the workplace.
