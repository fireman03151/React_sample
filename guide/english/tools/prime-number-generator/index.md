## Prime Number Generator

A prime number generator is used to generate prime numbers. Prime number generating algorithms are used extensively in computer science for various applications, examples: [Hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_table), [Public-key Cryptography](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-key_cryptography), etc.

Here are few online prime numbers generators:
* [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/examples/mathematics/number-theory/prime-numbers/)
* [Browserling's prime number generator](https://www.browserling.com/tools/prime-numbers)

There are various algorithms to generate prime numbers. Here's a link to one of the most efficient algorithms to generate prime numbers less than a number "n"
* [Sieve of Eratosthenes algo to generate prime numbers](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sieve-of-eratosthenes/)
