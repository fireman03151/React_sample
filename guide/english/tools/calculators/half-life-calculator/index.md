## Half Life Calculator

A half life calculator calculates the remaining quantity of a radioactive substance given the initial quantity, the time passed, and the half life of the substance (the time taken for the substance undergoing decay to halve its quantity).

More generally, a half life calculator could refer to any calculator that calculates one of the four aforementioned variables given the known values of the other three.
