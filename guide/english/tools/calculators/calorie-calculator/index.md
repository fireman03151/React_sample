## Calorie Calculator

A calorie calculator refers to a calculator that estimates the daily caloric requirements of a person given a number of variables, including weight, height, and age.

There are a number of equations that can be used in these calculators, and the end calculation and its accuracy may depend on which is used. A few of the most common ones include the Mifflin-St. Jeor equation and the Katch-McArdle formula.
