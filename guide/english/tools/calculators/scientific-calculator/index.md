## Scientific Calculator

Scientific calculator is just an extention to a basic calculator and can be used for various purposes. There is no fixed set of operations that a scientific calculator can perform infact it can get variably complex based on the use case. Generally, scientific calculators are used to quickly access certain mathematical functions, especially those which will take complex calculations even with a standard calculator.

Some good online scientific calculators to use on the go:
* Simply type "scientific calculator" in Google and hit enter
* [Desmos Scientific Calculator](https://www.desmos.com/scientific)
* [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/tour/): A whole engine for computing answers

### What is a Scientific Calculator?

A [Scientific Calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_calculator) is a more complex calculator which contains features and functions useful in science, engineering and mathematics. Scientific calculators are a reliable tool as they're usually solar powered and are quite portable. Depending on the model their features vary but typically they are functions include:
- Floating point arithmetic
- Trigonometry Functions
- Scientific Notation
- Logarithmic and exponentaion functions
- Constants such as pi and e

Typically they are used by students since they're most likely going to use these functions in their math and science classes. However, they can be used for other purposes other than academia. Scientific calculators replace the [slide rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slide_rule) an old form of calculating using a sliding ruler with marks indicating the answer.

The only thing better than a Scientific calculator is a [Graphing calculator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphing_calculator), which has a bigger screen for drawing graphs, more complex functions and more computing power than a scientific calculator.

### Types of Scientific Calculators

There are 2 screen types with scientific calculators:
- single-line display similar to traditional pocket calculators
- dot matrix displays

Single-line displays are usually found on the lower end budget options or from older calculators, such as the [Casio fx-991MS](https://www.casio-intl.com/mea/en/calc/products/fx-991MS/). They are often harder to use compared to the higher end options.

Dot matrix displays are typically found on higher end models such as the [Casio fx-991EX](https://www.casio-intl.com/mea/en/calc/products/fx-991EX/). They are more detailed compared to single line displays and offer textbook view which makes mathematical notataions easier to understand as they are replicated as how they are in the textbook.

The most popular brands for Scientific calculators are Casio and Texas Instruments. The lesser known calculator brands are Hewlett-Packard (HP), Sharp and Canon.
