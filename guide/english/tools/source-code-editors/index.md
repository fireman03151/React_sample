## Source Code Editors

Source code editors are the programs that allow for code creation and editing. Any text editor can be used to write code. But dedicated code editors offer many useful features, including: text completion, markup coloring, and tabs/panes for side-by-side editing. These features can be useful even to new users who don't know their way around all of the advanced options.  

There are many, many editors available to download or use online, both paid and free. They offer many of the same core-features, but each have their own subtleties. Further research may help find the one that's right for you. The following editors are all cross-platform and free to use or evaluate.

Sublime Text is free to download and evaluate, but the license for continued use costs $70.
