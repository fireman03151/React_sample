# Trees

A tree data structure can be defined recursively (locally) as a collection of nodes (starting at a root node), where each node is a data structure consisting of a value, together with a list of references to nodes (the "children"), with the constraints that no reference is duplicated, and none points to the root. A tree with no nodes is called a null or empty tree.

A binary tree is a non linear data structure consisting nodes, where each node has the following 3 components:

**Data element**: Stores any kind of data in the node
**Left pointer**: Points to the sub-tree on the left side of node
**Right pointer**: Points to the sub-tree on the right side of the node
As the name suggests, the data element stores any kind of data in the node.
The left and right pointers point to binary trees on the left and right side of the node respectively.

If a tree is empty, it is represented by a null pointer.

## Terminology used in trees:

**Root** :
The top node in a tree.

**Child**:
A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the Root.

**Parent**:
The converse notion of a child.

**Siblings**:
A group of nodes with the same parent.

**Descendant**:
A node reachable by repeated proceeding from parent to child.

**Ancestor**:
A node reachable by repeated proceeding from child to parent.

**Branch**(internal node):
A node of a tree that has child nodes.

**Leaf**(less commonly called External node):
A node with no children.

**Degree**:
The number of subtrees of a node.

**Edge**:
The connection between one node and another.

**Path**:
A sequence of nodes and edges connecting a node with a descendant.

**Level**:
The level of a node is defined by 1 + (the number of connections between the node and the root). 

**Height of tree**:
The height of a tree is the height of its root node.

**Depth**:
The depth of a node is the number of edges from the tree's root node to the node.

**Forest**:
A forest is a set of n ≥ 0 disjoint trees. 

### Some Popular Types of Trees:

- **Binary Tree**. It has the following properties:
  - The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ of a binary tree is 2^l-1.
  - In Binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children, number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children.

- **Binary Search Tree**. It has the following properties:
  - The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys lesser than the node’s key
  - The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node’s key
  - The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree

- **AVL Tree**. It has the following properties:
  - Height difference of left and right subtree of node should be less than 2
  - Re-balancing is done when heights of two child subtrees of a node differ by more than one

* Red Black Tree
* Splay Tree
* Huffmann Tree
* M-Way Search Tree (used for huge amounts of data)

### Common uses

* Representing hierarchical data
* Storing data in a way that makes it easily searchable
* Representing sorted lists of data
* Routing algorithms



### Code of a tree node

```cpp
struct node
    {
         int data;                 //Data element
         struct node * left;          //Pointer to left node
         struct node * right;         //Pointer to right node
    };

```
### Code for node creation
createNode() returns a new node with the given data and NULL left and right pointers.

```cpp
struct node* newNode(int element) 
{ 
  struct node* temp = (node*)malloc(sizeof(node));      //Allocate memeory for temp node
  temp->data = element;                                 // Assign element to temp 
  temp->left = NULL;                                    // Initialize left child as NULL 
  temp->right = NULL;                                   // Initialize right child as NULL
  return temp; 
} 
```
