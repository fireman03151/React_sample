## GIMP

Gimp is an acronym for GNU Image Manipulation Program. It's also open source and avaliable on Linux, OS X and Windows. 


### Why Should I Switch To GIMP?

- As I mentioned earlier it's FREE. The upgrades are also free!
- It uses a fraction of the space most other image editing software. This also means you a can have it running in the background and it won't slow down anything else you might be busy with!
- Also previously mentioned, it plays nicely with Mac/Windows/Unix. Particularly handy if you're collaborating with someone who uses a different operating system to you.
- It doesn't discriminate against your machine whether it's 8 years old or brand spanking new, you can rest assured GIMP will run without a hitch.
- Similarly to FreeCodeCamp's guides anyone can edit the core code or develop a Pugin.
- GIMP has batch processing capabilities through automated actions. If you're a photographer I'm sure the angels in your head just sang.
- You can open, edit and save Photoshop's native PSD file format in GIMP. Again, something super handy for collaborative work.
- If you're used to the layout of Photoshop you can easily replicate its look and feel (as well as keyboard shortcuts) in GIMP.
