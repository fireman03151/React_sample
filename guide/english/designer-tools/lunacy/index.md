## Lunacy

Lunacy is a windows version of sketch made by people over at Icons8. It is a free design software with the intention of being able to open sketch files so that designers on windows wouldn't be left out of the design ecosystem.

It doesn't have a collaboration feature, but it has a lot of features that people coming from sketch can use very easily, and it's still in development.
If you want to contribute, you can add things like tutorials and spellchecking to their github: <a href="https://github.com/icons8/lunacy-docs" target="_blank">Lunacy</a>
