## InVision Studio
 **NOTE:** InVision Studio is currently only available on Early Access sign-up and Mac only.
 InVision Studio is another interface design tool such as <a href="https://guide.freecodecamp.org/designer-tools/sketch">Sketch</a> with seamlessly integrated prototyping and animation functionality out the box and effortless communication tools aimed at making it easier for teams to design together. As does <a href="https://guide.freecodecamp.org/designer-tools/figma">Figma</a>, InVision Studio is built on the ability to connect with <a href="https://www.invisionapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">InVision</a>, allowing for multiple designers to work on the same project simultaneously.
 InVision Studio is really easy to start using and realistically only limited by the imagination and skill of the user. The UI itself is clean and easy to understand as it follows a similar layout to other software such as Sketch or Figma.
