## Redux Actions

Redux action is a simple object that describes what sort of event has happened in your application. They can even contain data that needs to be sent from the application to the Redux store. An action can contain anything but it must have a mandatory type property which describes the event taking place. A good practice is to use constants while describing the action.

For example:

```js
const ADD_ITEM = 'ADD_ITEM'

const action = {
 type: ADD_ITEM,
 text: 'This is the first item'
}
```

Using action constants allows us to reuse the `ADD_ITEM` variable in our redux reducer and also allows for easier refactoring.

We can send these actions to the store by using 
```javascript 
store.dispatch(action)
```

like so
```javascript 
store.dispatch({
 type: ADD_ITEM,
 text: 'This is the first item'
})
```
In real world apps it is often better to use functions aptly called Action Creators that accept a payload and return the action object, making them reusable.
```javascript
function addItem(text) {
  return {
    type: ADD_ITEM,
    text
  }
}

store.dispatch(addItem('This is the second item'))
```

An application can have different sorts of events happening at a time and these actions help describe these events. Without these actions there is no way to change the state of the application. 

## Action Creators

Sometimes it can be a bit verbose to run `store.dispatch({ type: ADD_ITEM, text: 'Text' })` every time you want to dispatch an action. This is why some people choose to make something called "action creators." An action creator is simply a function that returns an action object. 

```js
const addItem = text => ({
  type: ADD_ITEM,
  text,
})
```

Now if you want to dispatch that action to the store, just call that function: `store.dispatch(addItem('Text'))`.
