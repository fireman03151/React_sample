## Convert Fractions to Percents

Divide the top of the fraction (the numerator) by the bottom of the fraction (the denominator); then multiply the result by 100 to obtain the number in percentage form.

Example:

Step 1: 1/4 = .25

Step 2: .25 x 100 = 25%

In this example, we have determined that 1/4 equals 25%.
