## Subtracting Fractions

Subtracting fractions is a bit of a misnomer, as
```
(a/b) - (c/d) = (a/b) + (-c/d),
```
so there is nothing special going on here, it is just the usual [addition](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/blob/master/guide/english/mathematics/adding-fractions/index.md) of fractions. Namely,
```
(a/b) - (c/d) = (a/b) + (-c/d) = (a*d - b*c)/(d*b).
```

For example,
```
1/7 - 3/8 = (1*8 - 7*3)/(7*8) = -13/56.
```
