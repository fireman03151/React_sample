## Intro to Slope Intercept Form

### Slope Intercept Form: y = mx + b
The graph of a linear equation can be described by its slope and the point at which it crosses the y-axis, known as the y-intercept. A common form of representing a linear equation that follows this description is slope intercept form. *m* represents the slope of the line, and is often represented as a fraction. One way to remember how to interpret this fraction as a slope is "rise over run." For a fraction n/d, for every d units moved right, the plotted point moves n units up. *b* represents the y value at which the line crosses the y-axis.
