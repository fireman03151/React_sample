## Add Fractions with Unlike Denominators

In order to add fractions with unlike denominators, you need to rewrite the fractions so that they all have the same denominator. One way of doing this is to multiply all the unlike denominators together to create a common denominator, which is not always the smallest possible/optimal, but should always work. Other method is to divide larger over smaller, and them multiply smaller denominator fraction by the result.
