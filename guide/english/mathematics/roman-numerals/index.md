## Roman Numerals

The [numeric system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeric_system) represented by **Roman numerals** originated in [ancient Rome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ancient_Rome) and remained the usual way of writing numbers throughout Europe well into the [Late Middle Ages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Middle_Ages). Numbers in this system are represented by combinations of letters from the [Latin alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latin_alphabet). Roman numerals, as used today, are based on seven symbols.
