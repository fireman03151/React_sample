## Roman Numerals
  
I = 1 <br>
V = 5 <br>
X = 10 <br>
L = 50 <br>
C = 100 <br>
D = 500 <br>
M = 1000 <br>

How to Remember:<br>
"M e D i C a L X a V I e r".<br>
It has the roman numerals in descending order from 1000 to 1.

When a symbol appears after a larger (or equal) symbol, it is added:
<pre>
<b>Example:</b>
II = 2, (1 + 1 = 2)
VI = 6, (5 + 1 = 6)
XI = 11, (10 + 1 = 11)
</pre>

But if a symbol appears before a larger symbol, it is subtracted:
<pre>
<b>Example:</b>
IV = 4, (5 - 1 = 4)
IX = 9, (10 - 1 = 9)
</pre>

Don't use the same symbol more than three times in a row:
<pre>
<b>Example:</b>
III = 3
VIII = 8
XXX = 30
LXXX = 80
CCC = 300
DCCC = 800
MMM = 3000
</pre>
