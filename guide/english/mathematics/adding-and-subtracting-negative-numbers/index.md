## Adding and Subtracting Negative Numbers

Adding and subtracting positive numbers is fairly straighforward, but what does it mean to add and subtract negative numbers? Let's look at a real world example to get a better idea. Suppose we have a basket with some balloons tied to it pushing it upward and some weights tied to it pushing it down. Think of the force pulling the balloon up as a positive number and the force pulling it down as a negative number. If we add more weights, it's like we're adding a negative number and the basket gets pulled down. If we remove weights, we are subtracting a negative number and the basket gets pulled up.

### Examples

<pre>(-1) + 3 = 2</pre>

<pre>(-3) + (-3) = -6</pre>

<pre>(-2) - 4 = -6</pre>

<pre>(-10) + 2 = -8</pre>

<pre>20 + (-44) = -24</pre>
