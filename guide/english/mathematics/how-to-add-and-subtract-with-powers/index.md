## How to Add and Subtract with Powers

To add or subtract with powers, both variables and exponential powers of the variables must be same. The required operations is performed on the coefficients, leaving the variable and exponent as it is. The terms that combines always have exactly the same variables with exactly the same powers.

<pre>
<b>Example 1:</b>
2x + x = 3x
2x - x = x
Here both variables and their power are same, hence addition and subtraction can be performed.

<b>Example 2:</b>
2x<sup>2</sup> + x<sup>2</sup> = 3x<sup>2</sup>
2x<sup>2</sup> - x<sup>2</sup> = x<sup>2</sup>
Here both variables and their power are same, hence addition and subtraction can be performed.

<b>Example 3:</b>
3x<sup>2</sup> + 2x<sup>3</sup> = 3x<sup>2</sup> + 2x<sup>3</sup>
3x<sup>2</sup> - 2x<sup>3</sup> = 3x<sup>2</sup> - 2x<sup>3</sup>
3x<sup>2</sup> - 2y<sup>2</sup> = 3x<sup>2</sup> - 2y<sup>2</sup>
Here both variables and their powers are NOT same, hence addition and subtraction cannot be performed.
