## Perimeter

Perimeter is the measure of the distance around a shape. It can also be described as the sum of the lengths of all the sides and curves that form a shape. Likewise, in order to get the perimeter of a shape, you first measure the length of all sides and curves that constitute said shape in the same units, then add all measurements together.
