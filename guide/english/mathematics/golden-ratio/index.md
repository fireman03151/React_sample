## Golden Ratio

`PHI = φ = 1.61803398875...`

Two quantities are in the golden ratio if their ratio is the same as the ratio of their sum to the larger quanitity.

Given a > b > 0,
(a + b)/a = a/b = φ

The golden ratio is irrational, and can be represented as (1 + √5)/2.

The golden ratio is unique in that it is the only number where the inverse of the number is equal to the number minus 1 (as in, 1/φ = φ - 1).
