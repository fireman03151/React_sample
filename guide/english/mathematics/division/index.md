## Division

Division is one of the four basic operations of arithmetic, the others being addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Division is the inverse of multiplication; if `a ร b = c`, then `a = c รท b`, as long as b is not zero.


Division is represented by the symbol **/**, **รท**, or a fraction bar. Dividing is the process of calculating the number of times one number is contained within another one. For example, 15 apples are divided into three groups of five apples, meaning that fifteen divided by five gives three, or three is the result of division of fifteen by five. This is denoted as `15 / 5 = 3` or `15 รท 5 = 3`.
