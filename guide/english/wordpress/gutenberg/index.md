# WordPress Gutenberg Editor

The WordPress team is introducing a new editing experience beginning with v5.0 of the WordPress CMS. Unlike the previous Classic Editor, the Gutenberg editor bring a new block based editing system to the game. The functionality ships with many standard blocks that can be used to created and edit custom pages, but the system is extensible through the development of custom blocks. Learn more about the new editing experience using the link below.

## Block Boilerplate

Developer [Ahmad Awais](https://ahmadawais.com/) has developed a boilerplate and startup toolkit that can be used to help spin up your own custom Gutenberg blocks. You can learn more about this toolkit in Ahmad's Github repo here: [https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block](https://github.com/ahmadawais/create-guten-block)
