title: Bokeh
---
Bokeh is a Python interactive visualization library, providing the elegant and concise interface to create plot, dashborads, and data applications.  

This distinguishes bokeh from other visualization libraries such as matplotlib or seaborn. With the help of bokeh even very large data sets can be visualized. Because they can be adapted dynamically, e.g. by zooming into certain sections or selecting axes to be displayed, it is possible to provide a visual overview even over large amounts of data and to make the display interpretable.
