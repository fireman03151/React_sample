# Tableau

Tableau is a data visualization software for business intelligence. Tableau is commercially available through the Tableau Software foundation. Capabilites include highly interactive visualizations, mapping, and dashboards. A robust community for Tableau visualizations exists online, where many individuals publically publish their dashboards. 

# Getting Started with Tableau Public
If you want to learn Tableau on your own, it's possible to get a free license for the public version of Tableau. Not only can this allow you to import your own datasets into Tableau and create visualizations, but you can also publish these dashboards online and add to your public portfolio. 

- Link: https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/
- Start by creating an online account on Tableau's website, using the 'Sign In' button at the top right, and then clicking on 'Create one now for free'
- After you have done that, you can enter your email address and download the application to your local machine.
- If you want to learn from others, you can also download their published visualizations and take a look at specific elements.
