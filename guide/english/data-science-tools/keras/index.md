# Keras
Keras is a high-level library for practical deep learning. It is primarily used over other low-level APIs like TensorFlow, Theano, and Microsoft CNTK.

For beginners, it is a great tool to get started with deep learning because it takes out the nuances of defining each and every parameter and hyperparameter for the neural network. In fact, Keras has become popular enough to be used by numerous well-known organizations for making data driven products.

Keras speeds up the implementation process by eliminating boiler-plate code and keeping the developer focused only on the important details of the problem at hand.
