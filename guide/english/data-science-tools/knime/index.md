## KNIME Analytics Platform

Knime is a open-source platform for data science. It allows loading, cleaning, blending of data from many sources, data analysis, and data output/storage. Knime processes data with a series of nodes that either load, transform, manipulate, analyze, or otherwise work on tabular data in a series of steps that can be linked together in a workflow. With the addition of extensions from the community, integration of scripts written in Python, Java, R, and others is also possible, so that if a tool doesn't exist, you can create your own. Knime workflows can also be run from the command line, enabling the automation of data analytics processes.
