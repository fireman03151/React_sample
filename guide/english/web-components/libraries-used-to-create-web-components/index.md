#### Libraries for building web components

Nowadays, as the topic of web components gets more and more mature, there are a couple of valuable libraries which allow to create web components easily.
The most iconic one is definitely *Polymer*, which can be found [here](https://www.polymer-project.org/).
On top of that the most popular frameworks also allow to create web components:
1. *Angular* (min. version 6) https://angular.io/guide/elements
2. *Vue* (min. version 3) https://vuejsdevelopers.com/2018/05/21/vue-js-web-component/

Less known ones (which doesn't mean that these are any worse) are:
1. [https://x-tag.github.io/](*x-tag*)
1. [https://github.com/hybridsjs/hybrids](hybrids)
1. [https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte](svelte)
