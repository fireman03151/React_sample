Goroutines are functions or methods that run concurrently with other functions or methods. Goroutines can be thought of as light weight threads. The cost of creating a Goroutine is tiny when compared to a thread.

Prefix the function or method call with the keyword `go` and you will have a new Goroutine running concurrently.
