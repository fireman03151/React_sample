## Basic HTML


### Basic Page Structure:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
  </head>
  <body>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Sample HTML Program

```html
<html>
<head>
<title>Page Title</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>This is a Heading</h1>
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>

</body>
</html>
```

## HTML Headings

HTML headings are with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

Example:
```html
<h1>  Heading 1 </h1>
<h2>  Heading 2 </h2>
<h3>  Heading 3 </h3>
<h4>  Heading 4 </h4>
<h5>  Heading 5 </h5>
<h6>  Heading 6 </h6>
```

## Explanation
The `<!DOCTYPE html>` is to tell the browser you want the page to be rendered using HTML5.

The `<head></head>` is were you want to put things that help the browser and search engines such as `<title></title>` and `<meta>`.

The `<body></body>` is were the tags that will display on the page are such as `<h1></h1>` or `<p></p>`.
