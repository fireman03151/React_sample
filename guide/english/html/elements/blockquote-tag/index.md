## Blockquote Tag

### Purpose
The HTML `<blockquote>` element breaks out a quote from the surrounding content. This allows the reader to clearly see the quotation as material attributed to its original author. 

### Usage
Just like the "H" tags send signals to a reader that the information is important, the blockquote alerts a reader that the information they're reading is from an outside source.  The `<blockquote>` tag can include A URL for the source of the quotation may be given using the cite attribute, while a text representation of the source can be given using the `<cite>` element.
  
### Example
```html
<blockquote cite="https://www.cnet.com/news/tim-cook-maintains-steve-jobs-beatles-business-model/">
 “My model for business is The Beatles. They were four guys who kept each other’s kind of negative tendencies in check.
 They balanced each other and the total was greater than the sum of the parts.
 That’s how I see business: great things in business are never done by one person, they’re done by a team of people.”
</blockquote>
<cite>Steve Jobs</cite>
```
