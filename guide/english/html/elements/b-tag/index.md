## B Tag

Formerly used to bold text the `<b>` tag is now known as the 'Bring Attention To element' tag. It should be used only to draw attention to the contents of the element.

Most browsers will display text in bold type but you should not use it for this purpose, instead use CSS `font-weight` property for purely visual display reasons.  If you wish to signify the elements content are of special importance, use the `<strong>` tag instead.

An appropriate use case is drawing attention to keywords in a text. 

### Example:
```html
Examples of extinct <b>fauna</b>include ...
```
This would appear as:

Examples of extinct **fauna** include ...
