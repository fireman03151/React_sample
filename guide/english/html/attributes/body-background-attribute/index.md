## Body Background Attribute
If you want to add a background image instead of a color, one solution is the `<body background>` attribute. It specifies a background image for an HTML document.

Syntax: 

`<body background="URL">`


Attribute:

`background - URL for background image`

Example:
```html
<html>
  <body background="https://assets.digitalocean.com/blog/static/hacktoberfest-is-back/hero.png">
  </body>
</html>
```

## body-background attribute is depreciated
The body-background attribute has been deprecated in HTML5 and is no longer recommended for use. The correct way to style the ```<body>``` tag is with CSS.

There are several CSS properties used for setting the background of an element. These can be used on the <body> tag to set the background of an entire page.
