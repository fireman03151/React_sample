# Laravel

Laravel is a free and open-source PHP web framework available on [GitHub](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) and licensed under the terms of MIT License. It was created by Taylor Otwell who designed it with the objetive of enabling the development of web applications following the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern and it is now the most starred PHP framework on GitHub. Some of the main features found in Laravel are different ways for accessing relational databases, utilities that aid in application deployment and maintenance and at last but not least modular packaging system with a dedicated dependency manager.

Because Laravel is open-source the community around it is very strong and so is the documentation where you can learn how to do almost everything, try taking a look at the [Laravel Documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/) to get a glimpse of the open source power!

### Featured Packages

Ready-to-use bundles provided by Laravel through Composer and Packagist include the following:
