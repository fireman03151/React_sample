# Laravel

[Laravel](https://laravel.com/) is a free and open-source PHP web framework available on [GitHub](https://github.com/laravel/laravel) and licensed under the terms of MIT License. It was created by Taylor Otwell and designed with the objective of enabling rapid development of web applications following the model–view–controller (MVC) architectural pattern. It has gained a lot of traction over the years and is now the most starred PHP framework on GitHub. 

Some of the main features found in Laravel are different ways for accessing relational databases, utilities that aid in application deployment and maintenance, and a modular packaging system with a dedicated dependency manager. Laravel also simplifies a lot of common tasks found in web development and provides out of the box solutions for things like authentication, routing, and queues, allowing you to focus on your application.

Because Laravel is open-source, the community around it is very strong and the documentation is top-notch and example driven. Take a look at the [official documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/5.7/) to get a glimpse of how easy it is to use!

Ready-to-use bundles provided by Laravel through Composer and Packagist include the following:

- **Cashier** - introduced in Laravel 4.2, provides an interface for managing subscription billing services provided by Stripe, such as handling coupons and generating invoices.
- **SSH** - introduced in Laravel 4.1, allows programmatic execution of CLI commands on remote servers using the Secure Shell (SSH) as an encrypted network protocol.

- **Socialite** - introduced in Laravel 5.0 as an optional package, provides simplified mechanisms for authentication with different OAuth providers, including Facebook, Twitter, Google, GitHub and Bitbucket.:13
