## Evaluating Polynomials Synthetic Division

In algebra, synthetic division is a method of performing Euclidean division of polynomials, with less writing and fewer calculations than occur with polynomial long division. It is mostly taught for division by binomials of the form

The advantages of synthetic division are that it allows one to calculate without writing variables, it uses few calculations, and it takes significantly less space on paper than long division. Also, the subtractions in long division are converted to additions by switching the signs at the very beginning, preventing sign errors.
