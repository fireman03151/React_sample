## Heroku
Heroku is a cloud Platform as a Service (PaaS) supporting several programming languages that is used as a web application deployment model. One of the first cloud platforms, Heroku has been in development since June 2007. Initially it supported only the Ruby programming language, but now supports Java, Node.js, Scala, Clojure, Python, PHP, and Go. For this reason, Heroku is said to be a polyglot platform as it lets the developer build, run and scale applications in a similar manner across all the languages. Heroku was acquired by Salesforce.com in 2010 for $212 million.
