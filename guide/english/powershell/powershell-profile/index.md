title: PowerShell Profile
---

## Purpose
The PowerShell profile is a text-based configuration file for pre-session scripts and settings.  The profile is an easy way to customize the shell appearance, set a working directory, etc.

### Example
This will change the working directory to 'C:\temp' when a new session is launched.
```
Set-Location C:\temp
```
