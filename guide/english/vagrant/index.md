<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->
Vagrant is an automation tool that aids in creating and managing virtual machines that is simple to use and allows you to set up an environment quickly. This environment's exact installation and configuration can then be shared by using a Vagrantfile so other team members are all using the same environment, no matter what computer they are using.
