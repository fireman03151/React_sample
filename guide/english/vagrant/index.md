## Vagrant

Vagrant is an automation tool that aids in creating and managing virtual machines that are simple to use and allows you to set up a  environment quickly. This environment's exact installation and configuration can then be shared by using a Vagrantfile so other team members are all using the same environment no matter what computer they are using.

Vagrant can also be used with docker to start multiple containers, that are connected for one project.
