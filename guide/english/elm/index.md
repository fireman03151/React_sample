## Elm

Elm is a domain-specific, purely functional programming language that compiles into Javascript. This programming language is statically typed, and was developed with an emphasis on usability, performance, and robustness. Elm was built by Evan Czaplicki in 2012, and was influenced by Haskell, Standard ML, and OCaml among others. It also helped to inspire the popular state management tool, Redux.

### The Elm Architecture

Elm presents itself as a very opinionated solution to building web applications. This is clearly noticeable as it basically forces you to follow its prescribed [architecture](architecture). This is not a bad thing per se, and a significant upside of having to follow "the Elm way" is that it's a very consistent language: as you understand it more deeply, you become able to get productive when contributing to an Elm-based project very quickly.
