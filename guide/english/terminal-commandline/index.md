# Terminal/Command Prompt

Terminals are just the text i/o environment that lie between the user and the shells to provide graphical user interface to the shells.Shells are basically the program which run on terminal (shells could also be understood as the instructions which we give to the computer to interact with its operating system).

Actually in Unix based OS these interface are called "Terminal" while in windows OS it is called "command prompt".

It allows users to do almost any task that could be done with GUI(but simply in form of words or instructions) .One can copy, move and delete files, and even create undeletable folders etc from the terminal or command prompt itself.
