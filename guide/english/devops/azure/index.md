## Azure DevOps

Azure DevOps Services is a cloud service for collaborating on code development. It provides an integrated set of features that you access through your web browser or IDE client, including the following:

* Azure repos - Unlimited, cloud-hosted private Git repositories for source control of your code
* Azure pipelines - Build and release management to support continuous integration and delivery of your apps
* Azure boards - Agile tools to support planning and tracking your work, code defects, and issues using Kanban and Scrum methods
* Azure test plans - A variety of tools to test your apps, including manual/exploratory testing, load testing, and continuous testing
* Azure artifacts - Universal package respository allowing you to share defined packages such as Maven, npm and NuGet from public and private sources.
* Highly customizable dashboards for sharing progress and trends
* Built-in wiki for sharing information with your team

In addition, the Azure DevOps ecosystem provides support for adding extensions, integrating with other popular services, such as: Campfire, Slack, Trello, UserVoice, and more, and developing your own custom extensions.

Choose Azure DevOps Services when you want quick setup, maintenance-free operations, easy collaboration across domains, elastic scale, and rock-solid security. You'll also have access to cloud load testing, cloud build servers, and application insights. Azure Devops includes two flavors of free tier, one allowing unlimited users and build minutes in Azure Pipelines, however only public repos are allowed to be configured. Alternatively, unlimited private Git repos will only allow up to 5 users and limited to one concurrent Azure Pipeline with 1,800 monthly build minutes.

If you're also a current Visual Studio subscriber, you get access to the same free tier features without counting towards your free tier user count. Visual Studio Enterprise also includes Azure Artifacts and Azure Test Plans access.
