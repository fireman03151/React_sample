Packer is an automation tool that aids in creating pre-configured images for Public Clouds and some virtualization software like VirtualBox or VmWare. It is most often used in conjuction with Vagrant for local testing and with Public Clouds to provide a faster way to deploy hosting environment. Please note Packer still requires a way to provision such image i.e using configuration management tools like Ansible or Puppet
