### What is Transfer Learning ?

Transfer learning is the re-use of the pre-trained models on a different problem. It is very popular in Deep Learning as features learnt by one model trained on a Huge dataset can be re-used for another problem which as a small dataset to train on.

### Pretrained models

Some of the pretrained models that are widely used are :
* VGG16
* Xception
* VGG19
* ResNet50
* InceptionV3
* InceptionResNetV2
* MobileNet
* DenseNet
* NASNet
* MobileNetV2
