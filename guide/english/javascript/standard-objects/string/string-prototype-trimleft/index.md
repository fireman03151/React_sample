## String.prototype.trimLeft

The `trimLeft()` function removes any whitespace characters from the start (the left side) of a given string. It returns a new string. It does not modify the original string.

Examples:
```js
"  This string has two spaces at the beginning and a tab and two spaces at the end.	  ".trim();
// output: "This string has two spaces at the beginning and a tab and two spaces at the end.  	"
```

Note - `trimLeft()` removes any whitespace character, not just spaces or tabs.
