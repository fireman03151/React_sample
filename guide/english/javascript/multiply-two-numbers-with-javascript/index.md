title: Multiply Two Numbers with JavaScript
---
JavaScript uses the `*` symbol for multiplication.

Here is an example:

    var product = 8 * 10;
    
The variable `product` would have a value of `80` after this declaration.

When making calculations, it is possible to use parentheses `()` to prioritise which numbers should be multiplied together.
