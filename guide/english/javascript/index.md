title: JavaScript
---

Creaed by Brendan Eich in May of 1995, JavaScript is the most widely used scripting language on earth and has the largest library ecosystem of any programming language. It is the core language of the web, and the only programming language that can run in all major web browsers.

By definition, Javascript is a high-level interpreted language. This means the language is abstracted from the computer, easy to use, and doesn't need to be compiled in order to execute - it's interpreted at run-time.

JavaScript is the core language of the web and the only programming language that can run in all major web browsers.

Notably, JavaScript has no relation to Java. [JavaScript: The World's Most Misunderstood Programming Language](http://www.crockford.com/javascript/javascript.html)

The official name of JavaScript is ECMAScript defined under Standard [ECMA-262](https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-262.htm) ECMAScript 6th edition (ES6) added "significant new syntax for writing complex applications, including classes and modules" (Wikipedia) including arrow functions and promises.

## Standalone JavaScript engines
A standalone engine is a program which executes code without having to use any other sources for execution. In this case, it executes Javascript. Most browsers have their own way of dealing with Javascript.

Mozilla's SpiderMonkey, the first JavaScript engine ever written, currently used in Mozilla Firefox.
V8, Google's JavaScript engine, used in Google Chrome.

Google Apps Script, a cloud-based/server-side interpreter that provides programmatic "macro-like" control of Google Apps services and documents.

Node.js, built on top of Google Chrome's Javascript V8 Engine, a platform which enables server-side applications to be written in JavaScript.

Windows includes JScript, a JavaScript variant in Windows Script Host.

Chakra, a fork of JScript, is developed by Microsoft and used in their Edge browser.

Mozilla also offers Rhino, an implementation of JavaScript built in Java, typically embedded into Java applications to provide scripting to end users.

WebKit (except for the Chromium project) implements the JavaScriptCore engine.

## JavaScript Frameworks
