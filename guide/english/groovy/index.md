## Groovy
Apache Groovy or Groovy is a powerful and dynamic language with static compilation and typing capabilities for the Java platform and was designed to increase productivity with its concise and familiar syntax. It integrates with any Java program with ease.

### Hello World
Try the traditional "Hello World" example below:
```groovy
class helloWorld {
   static void main(String[] args) {
      // Use a simple println statement to print hello world to the console
      println('Hello World');
   }
}
```
