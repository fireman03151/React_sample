# Meet the Node console

---
## Problem Explanation
Make sure you have cloned the correct repository/glitch project and are writing your code in myapp.js. 

There are many methods available from the node console. You can find a list of these methods with Node.js documentation 
<a href='https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v10.x/docs/api/console.html' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>here</a>. A common use would be to log errors such as:

```javascript
console.log("An error happened");
```

**Note:** If you use Glitch
- Glitch had changed the 'Logs' button to 'Status' button, still on the top-left, under the app name
- Don't submit the 'Edit' page directly. Click the 'Show' button (on top) and submit the application show page's url (url format is like https://appname.glitch.me/)
