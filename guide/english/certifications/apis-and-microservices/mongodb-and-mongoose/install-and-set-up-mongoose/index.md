## Install and Set Up Mongoose

You might want to check both the [MongoDB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb) and the [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) NPM Repositories for the manual configuration if you are not using Giltch.

OR

1. You can use the glitch feature of search packages, install them and update package.json all by itself. (You should use fresh Glitch project from the url given in MongoDb and Mongoose first intro page).

2. Once done add the MONGO_URL in .env file and save your path as 
```` mongodb://<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@ds<PORT>.mlab.com:<PORT>/<DATABASE-NAME> ```` which you copy from mLab. Remember to remove the angle brackets ````<  >```` when you replace your username and password of your database.
