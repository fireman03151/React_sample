title: Install and Set Up Mongoose

# Install and Set Up Mongoose

---
## Problem Explanation
You might want to check both the [MongoDB](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongodb) and the [Mongoose](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mongoose) NPM Repositories for the manual configuration if you are not using Giltch.

OR

1. You can use the glitch feature of search packages, install them and update package.json all by itself. (You should use fresh Glitch project from the url given in MongoDb and Mongoose first intro page).

2. Once done add the MONGO_URL in .env file and save your path as 
``` mongodb://<dbuser>:<dbpassword>@ds<PORT>.mlab.com:<PORT>/<DATABASE-NAME> ```` which you copy from mLab. Remember to remove the angle brackets ````<  >```` when you replace your username and password of your database.

## Hints

### Hint 1
**Timeout error**

If the tests are timing out, check the `package.json` file. Ensure the final dependency does not end in a `,`.

For example, this will result in a timeout error:
```
"dependencies": {
  "express": "^4.12.4",
  "body-parser": "^1.15.2", 
},
```

### Hint 2
**add MONGO_URI to .env**
* Insert a line that looks similar to: `MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@<clustername>-vlas9.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true`. `<username>` and `<clustername>` will be automatically generated by MongoDB.

* Replace `<password>` with your password. There should be no `<>` characters (unless those are in your password).

Still having issues? Check the below hints:

* Remove spaces before and after `=`. This is correct: `MONGO_URI=mongodb...`. This is incorrect: `MONGO_URI = mongodb...`

* Do you have symbols or special characters in your password, e.g. `$&(@`? If so, you will need to translate these into unicode. MongoDB has instructions on how to do this. I would suggest changing your password to be lettes and numbers only for simplicity.

**.env**
  
```
GLITCH_DEBUGGER=true
# Environment Config

# store your secrets and config variables in here
# only invited collaborators will be able to see your .env values

# reference these in your code with process.env.SECRET
SECRET=
MADE_WITH=
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<ENTERYOURPASSWORDHERE>@<clustername>-vlas9.mongodb.net/test?retryWrites=true
# note: .env is a shell file so there can't be spaces around =
```

**package.json**
  
```json
{
  "name": "fcc-mongo-mongoose-challenges",
  "version": "0.0.1",
  "description": "A boilerplate project",
  "main": "server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
  "dependencies": {

  },
  "keywords": [
    "node",
    "hyperdev",
    "express"
  ],
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

**myApp.js**
  
```javascript
/** # MONGOOSE SETUP #
/*  ================== */

/** 1) Install & Set up mongoose */
const mongoose = require('mongoose');
mongoose.connect(process.env.MONGO_URI);
```
