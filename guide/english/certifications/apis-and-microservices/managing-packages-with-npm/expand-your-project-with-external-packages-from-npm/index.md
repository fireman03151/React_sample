<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->
You should go over to the `package.json` file in your project. Dependencies follow a similar convention as this:

```code
"dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.16.4",
    "helmet": "^3.14.0"
  },
  ...
```
