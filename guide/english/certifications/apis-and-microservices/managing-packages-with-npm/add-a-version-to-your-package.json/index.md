## Add a Version to Your package.json

<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->
You should go over to the package.json file in your project. Versions follow a similar convention as this:

```json
"version": "x.x.x"
```

This convention is also known as _**semantic versioning**_ where the versions follow the format `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` whenever a new release is made.
