NPM stands for Node Package Manager. It is a Package Manager bundled with Node.js. A Package bundles code in a manner that makes it easy to plugin or install the application or software contained within the package. There are many package managers, such as APT, Yarn, and NPM, that perform operations related to installing and configuring software packages to work on the system that the package manager is installed on. NPM is vital to Node, as it allows for easy management of Middleware such as Express.
