## Align All Items Vertically using align-items

In this challenge you are required to use the "align-items" property to vertically align all the items in the grid.

### Hint

You can vertically align the items by declaring the following in your CSS codeblock:

````css
align-items: value;
````

where value is how you could like to vertically align the items.

### Solution

Since the challenge requires you to move all the items to the end of each cell (vertically), declare the following in your .container CSS codeblock:

````css
align-items: end;
````
