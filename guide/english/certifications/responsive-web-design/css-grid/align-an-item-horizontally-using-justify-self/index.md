## Align an Item Horizontally using justify-self

In this challenge you are required to use the "justify-self" property to horizontally align a grid item.

### Hint

You can horizontally align an item by declaring the following in your CSS codeblock:

````css
justify-self: value;
````

where value is how you would like to horizontally align the item.

### Solution

Since this challenge requires you to (horizontally) center the item with the class `item2`, declare the following in your `.item2` CSS codeblock:

````css
justify-self: center;
````
