## Add Gaps Faster with grid-gap

In this challenge you are required to use "grid-gap" to define a row gap and a column gap.

### Hint

You can define the gap for the row and column by declaring the following in the .container CSS codeblock:

````css
grid-gap: 'row-gap' 'column-gap';
````

and inserting the desired parameters for 'row-gap' and 'column-gap'.

### Solution

Since the challenge requires you to create a 10px gap between the rows and a 20px gap between the columns, add the following code to the .container CSS codeblock:

````css
grid-gap: 10px 20px;
````
