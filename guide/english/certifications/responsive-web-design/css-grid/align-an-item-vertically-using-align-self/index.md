## Align an Item Vertically using align-self

In this challenge you are required to use the "align-self" property to vertically align a grid item.

### Hint

You can vertically align an item by declaring the following in your CSS codeblock:

````css
align-self: value;
````

where value is how you would like to vertically align the item.

### Solution

Since this challenge requires you to vertically align the item with the class `item3` at the end, declare the following in your `.item3` CSS codeblock:

````css
align-self: end;
````
