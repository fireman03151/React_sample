## Align All Items Horizontally using justify-items

In this challenge you are required to use the "justify-items" property to horizontally align all the items in the grid.

### Hint

You can horizontally align the items by declaring the following in your CSS codeblock:

````css
justify-items: value;
````

where value is how you would like to horizontally align the items.

### Solution

Since the challenge requires you to horizontally center all the items, declare the following in your .container CSS codeblock:

````css
justify-items: center;
````
