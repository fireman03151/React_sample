## Use CSS Selectors to Style Elements

CSS selectors are widely used to apply styling to all instances of a particular element.

To apply the color `purple` to all the `h2`s on the page, you can define the following CSS inside a `<style></style>` block.

```css
h2 {
  color: purple;
}
```

This will apply the color `purple` to all `<h2>` headings. If you are using the `style="color: purple"` attribute on each `<h2>` element, you can remove it and instead define it in a single place inside a `<style></style>` block.
