## Project Euler
[Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/), named for mathematician Leonard Euler, is a popular resource for practicing writing efficient algorithms. It is inspired by the shared goal of mathematicians and programmers to compose elegant and efficient solutions to complex problems. Project Euler is language agnostic. Rather than testing coded solutions, it presents a question to users and asks them only to input the correct answer. For this reason it is a popular platform for people who are learning new languages as well as those who want to practice writing more efficient solutions. The challenges presented by Project Euler are math problems of increasing complexity. Although all of these challenges can be solved by an algorithm that runs in less than a minute, the most obvious may take hours or even days to complete. The Project Euler platform does not run your algorithm and does not grade you based on its efficiency, but once you have solved the problem to arrive at a correct solution you will be granted access to a discussion forum of the challenge where you can get community help on how to improve your approach.
