**The Use of a Scatterplot Graph**

Scatterplots are a visualization intended for `numerical` data. That is, they display the relationship between one numerical distribution and another. For instance, a scatter plot may be useful in plotting the relationship between number of groceries bought and the total amount paid for them at checkout. 

Scatterplots are particularly beneficial in uncovering an association between two numerical variables. Associations can be `positive` (if both variables are increasing together towards high values) or `negative` (while one variable increases, the other's values decrease). If we see some points isolated from the rest, then we can understand that outliers are also present in the data.
