## Visualize Data with a Bar Chart

**Why Visualize Data**
Often, just having the data is not enough and can make it harder to understand if it is not visualized. The type of data helps suggest the best way in which to visualize it. Bar charts, for instance, are great in visualizing `categorical` data (data that is not numerical, whose averages do not have any significance) such as the count of how many times a different desserts were bought at a bakery. 

**Features of a Bar Chart**
Bars in a bar chart are equally spaced from another and have the same width. Their lengths are a proportion of the count of the category being displayed.
