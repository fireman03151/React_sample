## ES6

ES6 also known as ECMAScript6 or ES2015, is the latest widely accepted sets of rules and conventions laid out and standardized by Ecma International. Various new features such as constant value variables and arrow functions have been introduced in this new version.  Major web browsers support some features of ES6. However, it is possible to use a transpiler to convert ES6 code into ES5, which is better supported on most browsers.
