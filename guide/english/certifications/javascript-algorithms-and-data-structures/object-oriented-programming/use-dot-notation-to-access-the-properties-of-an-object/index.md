# Use Dot Notation to Access the Properties of an Object

---
## Problem Explanation

The following code will simply print `1` from the `obj` object.

```javascript
let obj = {
  property1: 1,
  property2: 2
};

console.log(obj.property1);
```

Following this logic, use the `console.log` operation to print both `property1`and `property2`to the screen.
