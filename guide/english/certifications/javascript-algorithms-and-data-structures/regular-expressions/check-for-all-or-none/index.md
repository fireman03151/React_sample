## Check for All or None


### Hint:
The difference between american and british English for the given word is: favorite-favourite. We need to define the existance of the letter u .

## Solution
```javascript
let favWord = "favorite";
let favRegex = /favou?rite/; // Change this line
let result = favRegex.test(favWord);
```
