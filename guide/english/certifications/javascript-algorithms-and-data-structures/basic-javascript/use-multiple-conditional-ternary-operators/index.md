## Use Multiple Conditional (Ternary) Operators

We need to use multiple ```conditional operators``` in the ```checkSign``` function to check if a number is positive, negative or zero.

Here’s a solution:

In the function body we need to add multiple ```conditional operators``` - as in our lesson:

```javascript
{return (num === 10) ? "positive" : (num === -12) ? "negative" : "zero";}
```
In this way, function can check if a number is positive, negative or zero.

Here’s a full solution:

```javascript
function checkSign(num) {
  return (num === 10) ? "positive" : (num === -12) ? "negative" : "zero";
}
checkSign(10);
```
