## Hints

### Hint 1
Objects are similar to arrays, except that instead of using indexes to access and modify their data, you access the data in objects through what are called properties.

Here's a sample object:
```js
var cat = {
  name: "Whiskers",
  legs: 4,
  tails: 1,
  enemies: ["Water", "Dogs"]
};
```
Objects are useful for storing data in a structured way, and can represents real world objects, like a cats.
