# Write Reusable JavaScript with Functions

---
## Problem Explanation
Functions allow you to reuse code over and over. Our task is to make a simple `reusableFunction()` that prints out "Hi World" to the console (which you can reach with **Ctrl + Shift + I**). 

You start off by using the `function` keyword, and then typing the function name (which follows Camel Case formatting). Then, type the `()`, and create the `{}` brackets. Like so:

```javascript
function reusableFunction() {}
```

Now, your function is ready to be typed in. Use the `console.log()` to print a message in the console.
