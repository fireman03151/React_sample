# Appending Variables to Strings


---
## Hints

### Hint 1
Make sure your spelling and spacing are correct. Appending strings (stored inside variables) can be done like so:
```js
var adj = "happy!";
var sent = "Today, I woke up being ";
sent += adj; // The result is "Today, I woke up being happy!"
```
