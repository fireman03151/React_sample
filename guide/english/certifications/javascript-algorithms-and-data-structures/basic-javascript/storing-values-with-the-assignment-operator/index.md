# Storing Values with the Assignment Operator


---
## Hints

### Hint 1
It's just like math! You can set a variable to act as a placeholder for data by using the '=' assignment operator. In other words, the variable will store the data.

```javascript
var a;
a = 5; // The variable 'a' is equal to 5

var zxcv;
zxcv = 123; // The variable 'abc' is equal to 123
```
