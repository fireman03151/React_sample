# Nest one Array within Another Array

## Hints

### Hint 1
Arrays are one-dimensional; that means they store only one row of data. But you can make an array multi-dimensional by putting arrays inside arrays! Like so:

```javascript
var arr = [["Two-dimensional", 2], ["Two rows", 12]];
```

The above array has two dimensions.
