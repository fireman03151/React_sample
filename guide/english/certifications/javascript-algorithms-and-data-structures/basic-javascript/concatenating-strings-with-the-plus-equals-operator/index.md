# Concatenating Strings with the Plus Equals Operator


---
## Hints

### Hint 1
The '+=' operator can concatenate (link) strings easily. Make sure your spelling is right, and you've left appropriate spaces.

```javascript
var str = "Hello ";
str += "coding"; // Now the string reads "Hello coding"
str += "camper!"; // And now the string reads "Hello codingcamper!"
```
