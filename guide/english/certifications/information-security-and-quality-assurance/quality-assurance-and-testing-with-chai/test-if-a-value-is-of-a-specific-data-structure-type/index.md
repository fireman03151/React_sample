## Test if a Value is of a Specific Data Structure Type

To begin, locate the file "tests/1_unit_tests.js" and scroll to the suite of tests for 'Objects'.

This file contains multiple suites of tests for the project, and this challenge requires you to make the tests in ``` /** 17 */``` pass.

## Hint 1

The challenge uses objects defined above the tests. Look closely at both, and determine whether the object or its properties will have the type being compared against in the assertion.

## Hint 2

Check the error messages to determine if your understanding of the object or property's type was correct.

## Hint 3

The lines in the test should be changed from `assert.fail()` to either `assert.typeOf()` or `assert.notTypeOf()`.

## Solution

```js
test('#typeof, #notTypeOf', function() {
  /** 17 #typeOf asserts that valueâ€™s type is the given string, **/
  // as determined by Object.prototype.toString.
  // Use #typeOf or #notTypeOf where appropriate
  assert.typeOf(myCar, 'object');
  assert.typeOf(myCar.model, 'string');
  assert.notTypeOf(airlinePlane.wings, 'string');
  assert.typeOf(airlinePlane.engines, 'array');
  assert.typeOf(myCar.wheels, 'number');
});
```
