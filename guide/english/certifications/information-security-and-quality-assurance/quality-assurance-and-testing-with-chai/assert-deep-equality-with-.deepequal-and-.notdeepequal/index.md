## Assert Deep Equality with .deepEqual and .notDeepEqual

To begin, locate the file "tests/1_unit_tests.js" and scroll to the suite of tests for 'Equality'

This file contains multiple suites of tests for the project, and this challenge requires you to make the tests in ` /** 7 */` pass.

## Hint 1

Deep equality checks if two objects, and their child objects, are equal to one another using the `==` operator.

## Hint 2

The lines in the test should be changed from `assert.fail()` to either `assert.deepEqual()` or `assert.notDeepEqual()`

## Solution
```js
/** 7 - .deepEqual(), .notDeepEqual() **/
// .deepEqual() asserts that two object are deep equal
test('#deepEqual, #notDeepEqual', function() {
  assert.deepEqual( { a: '1', b: 5 } , { b: 5, a: '1' }, "keys order doesn't matter" );
  assert.notDeepEqual( { a: [5, 6] }, { a: [6, 5] }, "array elements position does matter !!" );
});
```
