## Run Functional Tests on API Endpoints using Chai-HTTP II

To begin, open the file "tests/2_functional_tests.js" and locate 'Test GET /hello with your name'.

## Hint 1

Using the example above, look at the assertions and how they are making comparisons between the expected and actual values of the response.

## Hint 2

Make sure you have entered your own name (or whichever name you are inputting) into both the query (line 67)and the assertion for `res.text` (line 74) in order for the test to pass.

## Hint 3

The lines in the test should be changed from `assert.fail()` to an assertion that checks if the two values are equal.

## Solution

```js
test('Test GET /hello with your name',  function(done){ // Don't forget the callback...
  chai.request(server)             // 'server' is the Express App
  .get('/hello?name=John') /** <=== Put your name in the query **/ 
  .end(function(err, res){        // res is the response object
    
    // Your tests here.
    // Replace assert.fail(). Make the test pass.
    // Test the status and the text response. Follow the test order like above.
    assert.equal(res.status, 200);
    assert.equal(res.text, 'hello John'/** <==  Put your name here **/);
    done();   // Always call the 'done()' callback when finished.
  });
});
```
