## Test if a Value Falls within a Specific Range

To begin, locate the file "tests/1_unit_tests.js" and scroll to the suite of tests for 'Comparisons'.

This file contains multiple suites of tests for the project, and this challenge requires you to make the tests in ``` /** 10 */``` pass.

## Hint 1

`approximately()` requires a range to make the tests pass. The expected value for both tests is currently 1, so you need to find a range that allows for all values to be accounted for. 

## Hint 2

Check the error outputs, and try to understand what the +/- values in the errors mean with respect to a possible range of values.

## Solution
```js
/** 10 - .approximately **/
// .approximately(actual, expected, range, [message])
// actual = expected +/- range
// Choose the minimum range (3rd parameter) to make the test always pass
// it should be less than 1
test('#approximately', function() {
  assert.approximately(weirdNumbers(0.5) , 1, /*edit this*/ 0.5 );
  assert.approximately(weirdNumbers(0.2) , 1, /*edit this*/ 0.8 );
});
```
