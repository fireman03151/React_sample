## Disable DNS Prefetching with helmet.dnsPrefetchControl()

### Hint

- You want your `app` to `use` helmet's `dnsPrefetchControl()` method.

### Solution

- In the `myApp.js` file add `app.use(helmet.dnsPrefetchControl());` under the eighth instructions.

**Note:** Be sure to submit the link to the **live demo** of your project.
