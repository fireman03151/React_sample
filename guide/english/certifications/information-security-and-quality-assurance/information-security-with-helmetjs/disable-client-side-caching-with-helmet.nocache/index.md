## Disable Client-Side Caching with helmet.noCache()

### Hint

- You want your `app` to `use` helmet's `noCache()` method.

### Solution

- In the `myApp.js` file, add `app.use(helmet.noCache());` under the ninth instruction.

**Note:** Be sure to submit the link to the **live demo** of your project.
