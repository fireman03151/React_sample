## Prevent IE from Opening Untrusted HTML with helmet.ieNoOpen()

### Hint

- You want your `app` to `use` helmet's `ieNoOpen()` method on each request.

### Solution

- In the `myApp.js` file add `app.use(helmet.ieNoOpen());` under the sixth instructions.

**Note:** Be sure to submit the link to the **live demo** of your project.
