## Understand BCrypt Hashes

**Starting with this lesson there is a new boilerplate project to clone on glitch.** So be sure to start by cloning that first!

### Hint

- Add `bcrypt` to your project as a dependency.
- After you add it, you need to require it in the server file.

### Solution

- In the `package.json` file, click the `add package` button, search for `bcrypt`, and click it to add it to your project.
- Then, go in the `server.js` file, and require it by adding `const bcrypt = require('bcrypt');` near the top of the file by the rest of the dependencies.

**Note:** Be sure to submit the link to the **live demo** of your project.
