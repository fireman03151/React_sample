## Install and Require Helmet

For this series of lessons, it's easiest to clone the glitch boilerplate project and follow the instructions there.  
In this challenge you need to add and require helmet to your project.

### Hint

- You can search for packages on glitch somewhere when in your package.json file
- After you add helmet, you need to require it in the myApp.js file

### Solution

- In the `package.json` file, click the `add package` button, search for `helmet`, and click it to add it to your project.
- Then, go in to the `myApp.js` file and require it by adding `const helmet = require('helmet');` near the top of the file.

**Note:** Be sure to submit the link to the **live demo** of your project.
