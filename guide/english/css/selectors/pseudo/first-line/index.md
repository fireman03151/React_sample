## First-Line

The ```::first-line``` CSS pseudo-element styles the first line of a selected HTML element.

General Syntax:

```css
::first-line
```

## Example

```css
/* "First line of every paragraph is set to bold*/
p::first-line {
  font-weight: bold;
}
```

The ```::first-line``` CSS pseudo-element is often paired with the ```::first-letter``` CSS pseudo-element for a drop caps effect emphasizing the first letter and line of a paragraph.
