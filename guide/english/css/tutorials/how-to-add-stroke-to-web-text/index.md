## How to Add Stroke to Web Text  
The stroke effect adds a comic book(try comic-sans), or vector look to a webpage, you're adding a border to the existing text. It's great for headers!

```css
h1{
  -webkit-text-stroke-width: 1px;
  -webkit-text-stroke-color:#000;
  -webkit-text-fill-color:#fff;
}

```
* Text-stroke-width: How wide the stroke is.
* Text-stroke-color: The color of the stroke.
* Text-fill-color: The color filling the border. Without it, or if it's the same color, the text will just look bolder.
