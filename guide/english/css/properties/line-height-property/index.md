## Line Height Property
The `line-height` property sets the height of each line of text in an element. Lines in an element with a larger `line-height` will have more space in-between them.

A `line-height` can be set using...
* A fixed value (such as `25px`)
* A percentage of the current `font-size` (such as `130%`)
* A unitless number (such as `2`) which is multiplied by the current `font-size` (so `2` is double the `font-size`).
