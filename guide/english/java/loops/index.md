# Loops

Whenever you need to execute a block of code multiple times, a loop will often
come in handy.

Java has 4 types of loops:
* [While Loop](while-loop)
* [Do...While Loop](do-while-loop)
* [For Loop](for-loop)
* [For Each Loop](for-each-loop)

Loops behaviour can be customized using:
* [Control Statements](control-statements)
    * [Break Control Statement](break-control-statement)
    * [Continue Control Statement](continue-control-statement)

A special case of loops:
* [Infinite Loops](infinite-loops)
