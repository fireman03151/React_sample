## Quantitative Testing

A trick to remembering what quantitative is, is to associate it with "quantity" or something that can be measured; numbers. This type of research answers the "what" in terms of what is happening on the the website or app. Example: What percentage of users drop off the site at a certain page? How many clicks does a particular section get?

When user experience (UX) researchers conduct quantitative testing they will typically do so using various methods. These can include: surveys or questionnaires to evaluate whether or not the the site or app is easy for the user; using analytic software like Google Analytcs to assess the website's stats; heatmaps; or using A/B split testing, providing users two versions of the site or app to compare and determine which is more effective.
