## Defining the Problem
In defining the problem, we’re determining the root cause of what inhibits our users from completing the desired goals. It’s important to note that what a client or individual thinks the problem is and what the problem actually is, could be very different. Often, the client is too close to the issue or too fixated on another, unrelated issue. Research, at this phase, is critical to realizing the actual problem.
That is not to say, however, that the client should be ignored in the process. The client’s view of the problem should be considered and examined in a serious manner. However, it is just one viewpoint of the problem at hand.

In user experience research (UX), is is important to be able to define:

1. The problem
2. The goal
3. and the solution

In terms of defining the problem, or problem statement for your website or app, is to assess that a problem can exist if you have a complaint and a cause. What problems might you have? Make a list of issues you have a website and what is the cause. If there is a problem and you can identify the cause, it is possible others have encountered the same issue. 

When writing a problem statement, you might first ask the following questions (referencing back to the 5w's + h that we used in elementary school:

1. WHAT is the problem or WHAT is the user trying to do on the site?
2. WHO is impacted by the problem?
3. WHERE is this happening?
4. WHEN does this happen?
5. WHY does the user perform this task?
and finally, 6. HOW does the user perfom this task?

Once you have identified your user's problem, you can structure your problem statement. This statement is important as it will be how you go about formulating possible solutions to the issue.
