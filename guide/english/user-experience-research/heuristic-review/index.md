## Heuristic Review

A Heuristic Review is the process of evaluating the usability of the interface a site or piece of software by determining the extent to which it adheres to recognised 'best practices'. 


This could, for example, involve examining the discoverability of elements of a website, so as to determine whether a user will be able to navigate it intuitively.  It may also determine the extent to which a user is made aware of the current state of the site. 


While there are, of course, various criteria by which usability might be measured, the ten heuristics outlined in Jakob Nielsen are frequently used as a point of reference in this regard.
