User Flow is a fundemantal tool for every User Expereince Designer in predicting a Users actions and travel path through a product. By designing a User Flow a UX designer puts himself in the shoes of a fictional user and completes a task product they are designing. The resulting 'diagrams' are called a "User Flow Map"(not to be mistaken with "User Journey Map") and through it a designer could predict and plan the directions a future user might take when using a certain aspect of the product.
