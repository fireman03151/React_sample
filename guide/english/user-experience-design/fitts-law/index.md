## Fitts Law
Fitts's Law provides a model of human movement which can accurately predict the amount of time taken to move to and select a target. In human-computer interaction, Fitts's Law is typically applied to movement across the graphical user interface using a cursor or other type of pointer. In mobile screens, this could be the distance the finger has to travel from its current position to reach its target.

The law describes a simple rule of UI design that the distance from one point to the next should be reduced, while having the target object be larger to reduce the amount of time for selecting a target. Ideally, the further the user has to traverse towards a target, the larger that target should be in order to make the interaction more smooth.
