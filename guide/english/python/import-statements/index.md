title: Python Import Statements
---
While learning programming and reading some resources you undoubtedly came across the word _abstraction_, which simply means to reduce and reuse code as much as possible.

Functions and modules facilitate abstraction. You create functions when you want to do something repeatedly within a file.

Modules come into the picture when you want to reuse a group of functions in different source files. Modules are also useful in structuring the program well.

## Using Standard Libraries

Example: You can read about the methods/functions of all the standard libraries in the official Python Docs in detail.

```python
import time
for i in range(100):
    time.sleep(1)   # Waits for 1 second and then executes the next command
    print(str(i) + ' seconds have passed')  # prints the number of seconds passed after the program was started
```

```python
# To calculate the execution time of a part of program
import time
start = time.time() # Returns the number of seconds that have elapsed since the epoch
# code here
end = time.time()
print('Execution time:' , end-start)
```

## Using third party Modules

Sometimes third party modules do not come bundled with Python, but need to be installed using package managers like [pip](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py), [easy install](https://bootstrap.pypa.io/ez_setup.py), and [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv).

```python
# To make http requests
import requests
rq = requests.get(target_url)
print(rq.status_code)
```

## Local imports

Files/Modules in the same project can be imported just by their name. `import` also supports relative references to files/modules as shown below:

```python
# To import a file within a project from "adjacent module"
import '../adjacent_module/file_to_import'
```

However, as a good practice, it is recommended not to use relative paths in imports.

## To structure programs

We want to make a program that has various functions regarding prime numbers. So lets start. We will define all the functions in `prime_functions.py`:

```python
# prime_functions.py
from math import ceil, sqrt
def isPrime(a):
    if a == 2:
        return True
    elif a % 2 == 0:
        return False
    else:
        for i in range(3,ceil(sqrt(a)) + 1,2):
            if a % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

def print_n_primes(a):
    i = 0
    m = 2
    while True:
        if isPrime(m) ==True:
            print(m)
            i += 1
        m += 1
        if i == a:
            break
```

Now we want to use the functions that we just created in `prime_functions.py`, so we create a new file called `playground.py` to use those functions.

> _Please note that this example is far too simple to need two separate files -- it is just to demonstrate. But when there are large, complex programs, splitting the code into different files is really useful._

```python
# playground.py
import prime_functions
print(prime_functions.isPrime(29)) # returns True
```

## Sorting Imports

A good practice is to sort `import` modules into three groups - standard library imports, related third-party imports, and local imports.  Within each group it is sensible to sort alphabetically by module name. You can find [more information in PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/?#imports).

```python
# Order of importing modules
import time # Standard library modules
from package import calculate_duration # Related third-party modules
from package.sibling import example # Local modules within the project
```

One of the most important things to keep in mind when writing Python is legibility, and alphabetically sorting modules makes them faster to read and search through. Also, it is easier to verify that something is imported, and avoid duplicated imports.
