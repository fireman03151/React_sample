## Popular ways for developing GUI's in Python 3

Python provides various interfaces for creating Graphical User Interfaces(GUI' s). Some of them popular ways are as under:

**1. Tkinter**

It is the standard builds of Python include an object-oriented interface to the Tcl/Tk widget set, called tkinter. This is probably the easiest to install and use (since it comes included with most binary distributions of Python).

**2. wxPython**

It is an open source, portable GUI class library written in C++ that provides a native look and feel on a number of platforms, with Windows, Mac OS X, GTK, X11, all listed as current stable targets. Language bindings are available for a number of languages including Python, Perl, Ruby, etc.
 
**3. Qt**

It has bindings available for the Qt toolkit (using either PyQt or PySide) and for KDE (PyKDE4). PyQt is currently more mature than PySide, but you must buy a PyQt license from Riverbank Computing if you want to write proprietary applications. PySide is free for all applications.

**4. Kivy**

It is a cross-platform GUI library supporting both desktop operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and mobile devices (Android, iOS). It is written in Python and Cython, and can use a range of windowing backends.

Kivy is free and open source software distributed under the MIT license.

**5. Gtk+**

The GObject introspection bindings for Python allow you to write GTK+ 3 applications.
The older PyGtk bindings for the Gtk+ 2 toolkit have been implemented by James Henstridge.
