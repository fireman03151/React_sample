Python is known for its beautiful syntax and ease of readability. This scripting language can be used for some quick-and-dirty prototyping of your idea of a web-app. It can also be used to build scalable and maintainable large web applications.

#### Most Popular Python Web Frameworks:

So let's get started with some web frameworks and learn how they help build web app on-hands. But before that, we would need to set-up the development environment by completing [installation of web frameworks in Python](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/python/setting-up-python-web-framework-django-and-flask).
