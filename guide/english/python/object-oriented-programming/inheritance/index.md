## Inheritance

Because Python is an opject oriented programing language, classes created in Python are able to inherit attributes and methods from other classes.  For example:

```python
class ParentClass():
    pass
    
class ChildClass(ParentClass):
    pass
    
````
In the very basic example, the `ChildClass` class will inherit from `ParentClass` and use code defined under that class.  

Python is also able to support multiple inheritance, so child classes can inherit from multiple classes.
