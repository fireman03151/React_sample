## List Insert Method

The method `insert(i,x)` inserts a given value `x` into the list at index `i`. The index must be within the bounds of the list 
(from `0` to the length of the list minus 1).

#### Example Usage

```py
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
numbers.insert(3,8)
print(numbers)
```
#### Output
```
[1, 2, 3, 8, 4, 5]
```
The value `8` is inserted into the list at position `3`.
