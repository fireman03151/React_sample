## String Replace Method

The `str.replace(old, new, max)` method is used to replace the substring `old` with the string `new` for a total of `max` times. This method returns a new copy of the string with the replacement. The original string `str` is unchanged.

#### Examples

1. Replace all occurrences of `"is"` with `"WAS"`

```python
string = "This is nice. This is good."
newString = string.replace("is","WAS")
print(newString)
```

Output:

```shell
ThWAS WAS nice. ThWAS WAS good.
```
As you can see above, the "is" in This is also replaced with Was.

To prevent this we can use <br>

```python
string = "This is nice. This is good."
newString = string.replace(" is "," WAS ")
print(newString)
```

Now the output becomes:

```shell
This WAS nice. This WAS good.
```
Here the "is" between whitespaces gets changed to "Was" 

2. Replace the first 2 occurrences of `"is"` with `"WAS"`

```python
string = "This is nice. This is good."
newString = string.replace("is","WAS", 2)
print(newString)
```

Output:

```shell
ThWAS WAS nice. This is good.
```
