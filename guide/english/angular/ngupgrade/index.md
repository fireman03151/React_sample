## ngUpgrade
ngUpgrade is a library in Angular that allows you to run both angularJS and angular at the same time so you can begin upgrading your angularJS application to angular incrementally, essentially running both apps simultaneously while you slowly refactor the angularJS app over time until you're left with a single angular app.

#### More Information:
There are certain base requirements and suggestions to make to your angularJS app before beginning with ngUpgrade such as adhering to the style guide and upgrading to angularJS 1.5 or 1.6. You can find more details about using ngUpgrade to upgrade your angularJS app at the [official Angular Site](https://angular.io/guide/upgrade).
