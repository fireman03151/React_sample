## GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language developed by Facebook that provides a syntax to query data in from API. Unlike traditional REST APIs, GraphQL allows the client side of an application to ask for the exact pieces of data it requires in a readable way. 

GraphQL schemas are often coupled with frameworks such as [Relay](https://facebook.github.io/relay/) or [Apollo](https://www.apollographql.com/) to make these requests from the client. GraphQL powers how [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org) fetches data.


### Installation

From the command line run:

```bash
npm init
npm install graphql --save
```
