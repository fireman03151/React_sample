## Gatsby.js Plugins

Gatsby.js extends its functionality through its plugin system. Gatsby is designed to be extensible, which means plugins are able to extend and modify just about everything Gatsby does.

Gatsby plugins are Node.js packages that implement Gatsby APIs. For larger, more complex sites, plugins let you modularize your site customizations into site-specific plugins.

Plugins can but not limited to do the following below:

- add external data or content (e.g. your CMS, static files, a REST API) to your Gatsby GraphQL data
- transform data from other formats (e.g. Markdown, YAML, CSV) to JSON objects
- add third-party services (e.g. Google Analytics, Instagram) to your site
