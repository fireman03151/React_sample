## Gatsby.js PWA

Gatsby is designed to provide top-notch performance out of the box. It handles code splitting, code minification, and optimizations like pre-loading in the background, image processing, etc., so that the site you build is highly performant, without any kind of manual tuning. These performance features are a big part of supporting the progressive web app approach.

Gatsby mets the three baseline criterias for it to quality as PWA.

- It must run under HTTPS.
- It must include a Web App Manifest.
- It must implement a service worker.
