## SEO with Gatsby

Gatsby helps your site place better in search engines. Some advantages come out of the box and some require configuration.

### Server rendering

Because Gatsby pages are server-rendered, all the page content is available to Google and other search engines or crawlers.

### Speed boost

Gatsby’s many built-in performance optimizations, such as rendering to static files, progressive image loading, and the PRPL pattern—all help your site be lightning-fast by default.

### Page metadata

Metadata to pages, such as page title and description, helps search engines understand your content and when to show your pages in search results. With Gatsby, a common way to add metadata pages is to add [react-helmet](https://github.com/nfl/react-helmet) together with [Gatsby React Helmet plugin](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/seo/) for Server side rending (SSR) support.
