## Gatsby.js Starters

Running `gatsby new` installs the default Gatsby starter. There are many other official and community starters you can use to kickstart building your Gatsby site.

### Default Starter

Kick off your project with this default boilerplate. This barebones starter ships with the main Gatsby configuration files you might need.

#### Quick start

1.  **Install the Gatsby CLI.**

    The Gatsby CLI helps you create new sites using Gatsby starters (like this one!)

    ```sh
    # install the Gatsby CLI globally
    npm install -g gatsby-cli
    ```

2.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using the default starter
    gatsby new website
    ```

3.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd website/
    gatsby develop
    ```

4.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`

    *Note: You'll also see a second link: `http://localhost:8000/___graphql`. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql).*
    
    Open the `website` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

### Other Starters

Other starters offer more options and features but with depending on your working knowledge, working on these starters might not be pretty straightforward for beginners. [Check other official and community starters here](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/).
