title: Ruby Puts
---

The puts call is similar to the print call, with a few exceptions. The puts call will add a new line to the end of each argument, whereas print will simply print the argument as stated.  

For example, `puts[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` will output:

```ruby
1
2
3
4
5
```

While `print[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` will output:

```ruby
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```
