## Loops

Loops are used in PHP to perform repeated tasks based on a condition. 

Conditions typically return `true` or `false` when analysed. 

A loop will continue running until the defined condition returns `false`.

You can type `php for` , `php while` or `php do while` to get more info on any of these.


## PHP Loops
Often when you write code, you want the same block of code to run over and over again in a row. Instead of adding several almost equal code-lines in a script, we can use loops to perform a task like this.

In PHP, we have the following looping statements:

while - loops through a block of code as long as the specified condition is true
do...while - loops through a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as the specified condition is true
for - loops through a block of code a specified number of times
foreach - loops through a block of code for each element in an array
