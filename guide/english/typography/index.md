## Typography
Typography is a field that deals with the written word and how letters and characters are presented.

Text can be styled in different ways to convey different emotions or to emphasize different sections of a document or webpage. The typography that you choose effects how the text is interpreted and what the reader focuses on. Typography also effects the readability of your text. For example, a font which mimics a typewriter is much more difficult to read for a long period of time than a font like Times New Roman. 

In this section, we'll have guides to a variety of typography concepts.
