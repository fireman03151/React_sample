## Godot

Godot is a cross-platform, open-source game engine for both 2D and 3D games. It aims to be a fully-integrated game development environment, allowing users to create complex games without using external tools. Godot aims to provide users with visual, easy-to-understand tools that allow a high degree of creative freedom.

Juan Linietsky and Ariel Manzur began developing Godot in 2007, and Version 3.0 was released on 29 January 2018.

### Features

Godot supports programming in C#, C++ and GDScript; GDScript is a high-level scripting language similar to Python. There is also community support for several other languages.

Godot features 3D graphics using OpenGL ES 3.0 and a separate 2D graphics engine, as well as a complex animation system.  

Godot can be used on any desktop OS, and creates games that can be deployed a large number of platforms. 

### Games made with Godot

Godot has been used to make a wide range of games such as [Mr Bean - Around the World](https://www.goodcatchgames.com/game/mr-bean-around-the-world/) and [Last Carnival](https://okamgames.com/games-2/last-carnival/). More examples can be found at the [showcase](https://godotengine.org/showcase/)
