## Code Documentation

Code Documentation is a way for developers to communicate the intent or reasoning behind a piece of code. Successfuly documented code helps other developers get comfortable with the logic and use of the particular module, functions etc for a particular programming language. It is generally recomended that you document your code as you develop it; this way nothing is forgotten when development is being wrapped up.

For example, if you happen to pass along your code to an absolute beginner, they should be able to follow along via external documentation, comments, appropriate variable names; even if they have very little knowledge of the language in use.

It is a good idea to make a habit out of commenting your functions, loops, and declarations and treating comments as part of the source code.

Many developers have probably learned that it is much harder to go back through your code and comment it after you finish. It's always a good idea to label and comment your code as you go, so that you don't forget or mix up what certain variables or functions do.
