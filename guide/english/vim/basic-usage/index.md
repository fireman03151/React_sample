## About Vim

Vim is a text editor intended to be used in a CLI (command line interface) environment. It is highly configurable and built with efficiency in mind, without the need of a mouse or a graphical interface. It was built to be an improved version of the UNIX editor 'VI', or VI improved. That being said, VIM also has a GUI (Graphical User Interface) version named GVIM that shares the same core functionality as VIM but allows users additional feature such as additional menu and tool bars.
