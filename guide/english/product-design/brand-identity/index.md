## Brand Identity

Brand identity is how a business presents itself to, and wants to be perceived by, its consumers.

Brand identity is the face of a brand. While a brand is an emotional and even philosophical concept, brand identity is the visual component of a brand that represents those larger ideas.

Brand identity includes logos, typography, colors, packaging, and messaging, and it complements and reinforces the existing reputation of a brand. Successful brand identity attracts new customers while making existing customers feel at home. Itâ€™s both outward- and inward-facing.

It's vital that brand identity be consistent. Because it's representing and reinforcing the emotions of a brand, the message portrayed by brand identity components needs to be clear, and it needs to be the same no matter where it's displayed.

## A Brand Is Living, Breathing, and Adapting

It's important to note that a brand also in some aspects goes beyond their product. The personality of the executives have the largest impact on brand, due to their level of influence. Thereon the higher up's energy trickles down to the employees which determines the workplace environment. This determines how the employees feel about the company, which in turn determines the atmosphere that the customers can feel.

Before looking to change, maintain, or develop the identity of one's brand, it is crucial that one first looks inwardly. It is what will be initially projected and provide the first impression.
