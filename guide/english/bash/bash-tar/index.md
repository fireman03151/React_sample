## Bash command: tar

**GNU 'tar' saves many files together into a single tape or disk archive, and can restore individual files from the archive.**

Examples :

_Create archive.tar from files file1 and file2_
```
tar -cf archive.tar file1 file2
```
_Extract all files in current directory_
```
tar -xf archive.tar
```
