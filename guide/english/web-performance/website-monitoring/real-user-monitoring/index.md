## Real User Monitoring

Real User Monitoring is a passive monitoring technology that is used to record all user interaction with a website or client interacting with a server or cloud-based application. Passive monitoring can be very helpful in troubleshooting performance problems once they have occured. 

Real User Monitoring(RUM) functions by collecting a website or app's performance measures straight from the browser of the end user. Javascript is embedded in each page for this purpose and it collects data as a user explores the page and transfers the data for the analysis.

RUM is different from Synthetic monitoring. Synthetic moitoring is active web monitoring where as RUM is a form of passive web monitoring. So, unlike synthetic monitoring, RUM never rests.
