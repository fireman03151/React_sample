# Wireframing

A wireframe is a two-dimensional illustration of a page’s interface that specifically focuses on space allocation and prioritization of content, functionalities available, and intended behaviors.
Wireframing is a way to design an application at the structural level. A wireframe is commonly used to lay out content and functionality on a page which takes into account user needs and user journeys. Wireframes are used early in the development process to establish the basic structure of a page for these reasons: wireframes typically do not include any styling, color, or graphics. Wireframes also help establish relationships between a website’s various templates.
