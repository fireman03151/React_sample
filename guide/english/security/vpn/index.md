## VPNs
VPN (Virtual Private Network) is a technology that lets you browse the web anonymously and safely. It creates tunnels between two hosts using various types of encryption protocols, such as SSL/TLS. Users can share data as if they were connected directly (no one else can see their connection details). VPN can be also used to bypass geo-blocking or censorship. VPN may be considered as Tor alternative.
