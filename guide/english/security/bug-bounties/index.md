## Bug Bounties

Bug bounties are programs that are set up by companies to encourage people to check their products for vulnerabilities.  In return these companies can offer cash prizes for the discovered vulnerabilities. Many companies have stringent requirements as to which discovered vulnerability would be considered for a cash prize. It's important to understand the limitations and rules for each organization prior to doing any bug hunting.

### Benefits to bounty hunters
The benefits to the bounty hunters are fairly straightforward.  They get paid for what they find and get to improve their skills

### Benefits to companies
The companies that sponsor these programs gain several benefits:

- Many eyes on their product are more likely to find more bugs than the typical QA team
- Only have to pay for results, not for the time spent trying to find bugs
- Encourages people who find vulnerabilties to turn them over to the company and not to the black market.
