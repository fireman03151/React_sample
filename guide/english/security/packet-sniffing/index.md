## Packet Sniffing

Packet Sniffing is the process/strategy of intercepting/capturing traffic on the Network Level. The purpose of this act is to recover and analyze data passing through the target network such as sensitive information.  This can also be used by network engineers or technicians to analyze and diagnose a network infrastructure to identify problems.

### Packet Sniffing Software

Also known as Packet Sniffers, can come in the form of either a dedicated hardware solution or software applications using the network 
infrastructure of the target computer to collect information or inject malicious data.

### Protection from Packet Sniffing

The best/simplest way to keep data on a network safe is to use encryption such as Secure-Socket-Layer (SSL) or Transport-Layer-Security (TLS). Encrypting network data will not prevent packet sniffers from acquirring the source and destination details of specific data, but it will prevent the data being passed from being readable by the sniffers.

Alternatively there are multiple tools available for technicians or administrators to identify wether or not a network has been compromised.

These tools can detect if a network is in 'Promiscuous Mode', the required state for capturing network data.
