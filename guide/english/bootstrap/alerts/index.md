## Alerts

Make alert messages with the Bootstrap Framework.

#### How To Use:
The alert is a very easy to use component and below are code snippets that can help you show alerts.

**Code Example:**

`<div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">A simple primary alertâ€”check it out!</div>` 

To alter the color of the alerts, change the `alert-primary` class to any Bootstrap color class you desire. 

Here is a quick-reference to the [Bootstrap Color Classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/utilities/colors/).
