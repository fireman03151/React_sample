## Icons

The Bootstrap framework provides you with Glyphicons for icons.
Bootstrap doesnâ€™t include an icon library by default, but it has a handful of recommendations for you to choose from. While most icon sets include multiple file formats, we prefer SVG implementations for their improved accessibility and vector support.



### How to use

To use a Bootstrap icon, create a span tag with base class `glyphicon` and  individual icon class.  Use it only on elements that contain no text content and have no child elements.

**Code Example:**

`<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-search" aria-hidden="true"></span>`

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-search" aria-hidden="true"></span>

`<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-cog"></span>`

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-cog"></span>

The Bootstrap framework provides you with over 250 icons called glyphs. They come in font format from the Glyphicon Halflings set. Glyphicons Halflings are normally not available for free, but their creator has made them available for Bootstrap free of cost. As a thank you, they only ask that you include a link back to Glyphicons whenever possible.

### How To Use

To use Bootstrap icons you simply create a `<span>` tag and apply the applicable CSS class for the icon. A code example has been provided below.

**Code Example:**

`<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-search" aria-hidden="true"></span>`

<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-search" aria-hidden="true"></span>

_Note: Do not include the dot in the HTML Class Attribute, referring to the classes with a dot is only used when adjusting the classes in CSS._

### Bootstrap Icon in Buttons

```html
  <button type="button" class="btn btn-default" aria-label="Left Align">
    <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-align-left" aria-hidden="true"></span>
  </button>
```
<button type="button" class="btn btn-default" aria-label="Left Align">
  <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-align-left" aria-hidden="true"></span>
</button>

_Note: Bootstrap's Glyphicons are not available on bootstrap V4_

### Things to keep in mind

**Don't mix with other components**

Icon classes cannot be directly combined with other components. They should not be used along with other classes on the same element. Instead, add a nested `<span>` and apply the icon classes to the `<span>`.

**Only use icons on empty elements**

Icon classes should only be used on elements that contain no text content and have no child elements.

_Note: Bootstrap's Glyphicons icon is not avalable on bootstrap V4. However, it still works with V3.3.7 which is avaialble at the link provided below_.
