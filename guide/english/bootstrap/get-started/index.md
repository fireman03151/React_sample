#### How do I add Bootstrap to my page?

Adding bootstrap to your page is a fast process, just add the following to the `<head>` tags in your code.
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.1.3/css/bootstrap.min.css" integrity="sha384-MCw98/SFnGE8fJT3GXwEOngsV7Zt27NXFoaoApmYm81iuXoPkFOJwJ8ERdknLPMO" crossorigin="anonymous">
```

Some Bootstrap components require other JavaScript files, check out the Bootstrap documentation <a href='https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/getting-started/introduction/#js'>here</a> to find the latest scripting files.

You will also need to add the following between the `body` tags in your code. With bootstrap you'll be using `<div>` tags when using many of Bootstrap's features, e

```html
<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
    <strong>Congratulations!</strong>
    <p>Bootstrap is now working on this page</p>
</div>
```
<div class="alert alert-success" role="alert">
    <strong>Congratulations!</strong>
    <p>Bootstrap is now working on this page</p>
</div>

### Installing Bootstrap with a Package Manager

A popular package manager is NPM or Node Package Manager. You will need to install Node.js, which includes the Node Package Manager.
Visit [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download the necessary files based on your OS, and then install them.

Once installed and setup, open up the command line or console, and type the following in the the project folder you wish to use Bootstrap with. At the time of writing this will install Bootstrap version 4.0.0

```html
npm install bootstrap@4.0.0 --save
```

Once NPM has finished downloading and installing Bootstrap 4, there will be a new folder called `node_modules` within your project folder if it wasn't already there.

* `/bootstrap` which contains the CSS and Sass version of our files.
* `/jquery` which is used by Bootstrap in various components.
* `/tether` which is a library for element positioning.
