# Drupal

Drupal is an open source content management software. Like WordPress, it is based on PHP and MySql. It has a strong core suite of features, but its strength comes in its modular design enabling users and developers alike to alter the product to fit their needs and use case.

Drupal is heavily supported through its vast community of developers and contributors. Architecturally, it is built on the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySql, PHP) but it does have the ability to run on Windows or MAC using Nginx or ISS and PostgreSQL or SQLlite.

Just a few advantages of Drupal:
* Highly customizable through modules, themes and plugins.
* Tough security with no widley exploited breaches without patches 
* Fluxuates seamlessly through traffic and load highs and lows
