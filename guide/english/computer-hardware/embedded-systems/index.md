## Embedded Systems

An Embedded System is a dedicated computing system designed to perform a specific task. It is often used within a larger system. Instead of receiving command and programs to perform as in a general-purpose computer, the embedded system will continuously perform the same tasks and is supposed to recover from minor errors on its own.
