## Power Supply

A Power Supply Unit (PSU) supplies power to a computer. It converts AC power into steady low-voltage DC power for the internal components. A power supply is required in order for a computer to operate properly and it's wattage must be matched appropriately to all the components inside the computer.  


A PSU is usually not user serviceable. For your safety, it is wise to never open a power supply unit.
