## Accessibility Tools for Web Developers
There are many tools and online resources that can help you to ensure that your web application meets all of the accessibility requirements.

### General

### Screen Reader
A screen reader is a software application with assistive technology that attempts to convey what people with normal eyesight see on a display to their users via non-visual means, like text-to-speech. 
Developers can utilize a screen reader to understand how a webpage can be made accessible to such people and develop the page accordingly. Some of the most well known and widely used screen readers are:

- **[NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/)**
   NVDA(Non Visual Desktop Access) Screen reader is a Free & Open-source downloadable Screen Reader software for Windows OS.

   JAWS(Job Access With Speech) is a computer screen reader program which is available as licensed software for Windows.
   
- **[a11yproject](https://a11yproject.com/)**
   This site provides practical guides and examples for implementing accessible features and components during web development. The site contains how-tos, myths, tips, and recommended accessibility tools. The project is community-driven and can be contributed to on Github.
   
- **[ChromeVox](https://www.chromevox.com/)**
