title: How Free Code Camps Nonprofits Projects Work
---

In the past, freeCodeCamp.org built one-off projects for individual nonprofits. 

This was a very hands-on, time-consuming process, and only a few people were able to participate in each project.

We've instead switched to building more general open source projects that many nonprofits can make use of.

For example, we built and maintain [Mail for Good](https://github.com/freecodecamp/mail-for-good), which nonprofits (including freeCodeCamp.org itself) can use to send emails at a mere fraction of traditional email services (it only costs $1 to send 10,000 emails).

We have a ton of additional projects we plan to build in the near future, too.

You can contribute to these open source projects whenever you feel ready.

Clone one of these repositories, get it running locally on your computer, then start browsing the repo's open issues for an issue to work on. If you have questions, you can ask any time in the [Contributors section of our forum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/c/contributors)
