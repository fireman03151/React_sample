Pair programming is best described as two people writing code together on a single device.

Pair programming encourages you to discuss different approaches to solving problems, and to keep one another other motivated. The result should be better code than either of you could have probably written individually.

Typically the pair consists of a "driver" who is at the keyboard, and a "navigator", who is also actively engaged in the programming process.

Because of the benefits, many engineers pair program on a regular basis. It is also a very good way to learn coding. There are tools that allow two people to share mouse and keyboard inputs, enabling you to pair program with a friend or coworker without needing to be in the same room.

You can experience these benefits by pair programming with other Free Code Camp students on our coding challenges. Eventually, you'll work with people at nonprofits to build real-life software solutions.
