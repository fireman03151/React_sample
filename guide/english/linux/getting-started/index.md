## Choosing a distribution.


There are various types of Linux distributions to choose from nowadays, choosing one is a major concern in the Linux world. Taking in consideration easy to use OSs, the top dogs in this category are:
* [Ubuntu](https://www.ubuntu.com/) - Derivative of the stable Debian system, Ubuntu thrives in the a easy to use and up to date environment.
* [Mint](https://linuxmint.com/) - Based on Ubuntu and Debian, this OS has great features like Ubuntu's PPA compatibility, the apt package manager. The base mint distribution remind of Windows, this can be a nice characteristic for users comming from Windows. 
* [Trisquel](https://trisquel.info/) - A distribution  derived from Ubuntu that focuses on only utilizing fully free software, avoiding proprietary software. Trisquel is endorsed by the Free Software Foundation (FSF).

Some other choices include:
* [CentOS](https://www.centos.org/) - Based off of Red Hat Enterprise Linux. Community supported and stable.
* [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/) - Created by the Red Hat company to run newer packages than the stable enterprise releases. Community supported. 
* [Debian](https://www.debian.org/) - Created with completely free software. Many popular, "easy to use" derivatives are based off of Debian.
* [Arch](https://www.archlinux.org/) - An extremely customizable distribution. Not recommended for beginners.
* [Gentoo](https://www.gentoo.org/)
* [Suse](https://www.suse.com/)


## Installing.


Most Linux distributions are extremely easy to install, all information is shown between each step of the installation.

One important step to look out for is when deciding where to install your new Linux distro. For first-time users it's better to choose the "Guided" option as it will do all the work for you.

Remember to read all the steps carefully and leave some space in your HDD for the new distro, I would say about 30Gb minimum is nice to have.

## The Dreaded Terminal.


Linux's terminal is not to be feared, actually it is quite easy to use with some practice and it can make our daily tasks easy to automate.

In Debian/Ubuntu and derivatives, the shortcut to open the CLI (Command Line Interface) is "Ctrl + Alt + T". Let's open the terminal and try some commands.

cd (Change Directory) - The cd command is one of the commands you will use the most at the command line in Linux. It allows you to change your working directory. You use it to move around within the hierarchy of your file system.

```unix
cd
```

Using the cd command alone will change the current directory to your user home directory, located in "/home/username" as in "/home/mark".

ls (List) - This command list the content in the current directory. It can also be used to list file information.

```unix
ls
```
Now we can see our directories in our home.


pwd (Print Working Directory) - This command lists the directory you are currently in.

```unix
pwd
```
