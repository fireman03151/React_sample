## What is R Markdown? 
According to [R-bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/), [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is a great way to create dynamic documents with embedded chunks of R code. The document is self contained and fully reproducible which makes it very easy to share. In other words, it allows you to create documents that serve as a neat record of your analysis.

## Installation
Like the rest of R, [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) is free and open source. This package can be installed from CRAN with:
```r
install.packages("rmarkdown")
```
