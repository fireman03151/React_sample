# Introduction

Vue.js (commonly referred to as **Vue**,  pronounced /vjuː/) is an open-source progressive JavaScript framework for building user interfaces.

Vue.js was first released in 2014 by Evan You. It was created as a better version of Angular - lighter, removing all extra concepts, and easier to learn.

Its core is focused on the "view" layer only and can be easily integrated with existing libraries and projects.
But on the other hand, Vue.js can also be leveraged to create powerful single page applications by integrating with extensions
such as `vue-router` for page routing and `vuex` for state management.

Its main attributes are the following:
* It's approachable: if you know basic HTML, CSS & JavaScript - then you'll be writing apps in Vue.js in no time!
* It's versatile: you can use it as a simple library or a fully featured framework
* It's performant: it's extremely performant out of the box with very little to almost no optimization required.
