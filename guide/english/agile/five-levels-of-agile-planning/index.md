## Five Levels of Agile Planning

A product owner needs to be familiar with the five levels of agile planning:
  - Defining the product vision
  - Defining the product roadmap
  - Release planning
  - Sprint planning
  - Accounting for the outcome of daily scrums
  
Agile planning is always continuous and should be revised at least every three months.

## Brief Synopsis of the Five Levels of Agile Planning

 Product Vision: What (Summary of the major benefits & features the product will provide), Who (Stakeholders), Why (Need & Opportunity), When (Project scheduling & time expectations), Constraints and Assumptions (impacts risk & cost).
 
 Product Roadmap: Releases - Date, Theme/Feature Set, Objective, Development Approach.
 
 Release Planning: Iteration, Team Capacity, Stories, Priority, Size, Estimates, Definition of Done.
 
 Sprint Planning: Stories - Tasks, Definition of Done, Level-of Effort, Commitment
 
 Daily Planning: What did I do yesterday? What will I do today? What is blocking me?
