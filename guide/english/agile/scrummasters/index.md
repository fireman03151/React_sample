## Scrum Master

The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring Scrum is understood and enacted by not only the Scrum team, but throughout the organization as well. Scrum Masters do this by ensuring that the Scrum Team adheres to Scrum theory, practices, and guidelines.

The Scrum Master is a servant-leader for the Scrum Team. The Scrum Master helps those outside the Scrum Team understand the Scrum framework, and which of their interactions with the Scrum Team are helpful and which prohibit sprint progress. The Scrum Master helps everyone change these interactions to maximize the value created by the Scrum Team.

### Scrum Master's Job

- Facilitating (not participating in) the daily standup
- Helping the team maintain their burndown chart
- Setting up retrospectives, sprint reviews or sprint planning sessions
- Shielding the team from interruptions during the sprint
- Walking the product owner through more technical user stories
- Encouraging collaboration between the Scrum team and product owner  
- Making sure that obstacles that affect the team are removed, by doing it themselves or helping the team learn how to handle the obstacle
- Assisting the product owner with understanding the practice of writing, splitting, and prioritizing user stories

Typically a Scrum Master will ask the following qustions during the daily stand up meeting: 

1. What did you do yesterday?
2. What are you going to do today?
3. Is there anything slowing downn or stopping your progress?

Scrum Masters are part of an Agile team. They can be developers or other functional members (wearing multiple hats) or functioning individually as a sole role in a team. Their main objective is to coach the Scrum team and facilitate sprint progress using the Scrum framework.

Often their role is to: guide in sprint planning and scoping meetings, facilitate daily standup, conduct sprint retrospectives, help scoping of Sprints, hslping the product owner and team to construct and split user stories, ensure sprint velocity is present by removing blockers and encouraging collaboration between developers as well as the product owner.
