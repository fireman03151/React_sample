## Scrum

Scrum is one of the methodologies under the Agile umbrella. The name is derived from a method of resuming play in the sport of rugby, in which the entire team moves together to make ground. Similarly, a scrum in Agile involves all parts of the team working on the same set of goals. In the scrum method, a prioritized list of tasks is presented to the team, and over the course of a "sprint" (usually two weeks), those tasks are completed, in order, by the team. This ensures that the highest-priority tasks or deliverables are completed before time or funds run out. 

## Scrum Components

Scrum is often described as a repetitive as well as cumulative agenda in agile software development environments.  Where project management is the focus, scrum effectively aids in the production process.

The Scrum process is made up of the following items:

- Theme
- Epic 
- Stories
- Scrum tasks


- A set of roles (delivery team, product owner, and scrum master)
- Ceremonies (sprint planning, daily standup, sprint review, sprint retrospective, and backlog grooming)
- Artifacts (product backlog, sprint backlog, product increment, and info radiators and reports).
- The main goal is to keep the team aligned on project progress to facilitate rapid iteration.
- Many organizations have opted for Scrum because unlike the Waterfall model, it ensures a deliverable at the end of each Sprint.

## Artifacts
- Sprint: It is the time duration, mostly in weeks, for which a Team works to achieve or create a deliverable. A deliverable can be defined as a piece of code or fragment of the Final Product which the team wants to achieve. Scrum advises to keep the duration of a Sprint between 2-4 weeks.
- Product Backlog: It is the list of tasks a Team is supposed to finish within the current Sprint. It is decided by the Product Owner, in agreement with the Management as well as Delivery Team.

## Roles
- **Product Owner(PO)**: The ONLY accountable person to the Management (or any stakeholders). The PO decides what goes in or out of the Product Backlog, for making decisions in a timely manner, and for providing information in a timely manner.
- **Delivery Team**: The Delivery Team is required to work in accordance with the tasks set by their PO in the product backlog and deliver the required deliverable at the end of the sprint.
- **Scrum Masters(SM)**: - Scrum Masters are the Team Lead and have to strictly adhere to the Scrum Guide and make the team understand the need to adhere to it as well. It is the Scrum Master's job to ensure that all Scrum ceremonies are being conducted on time and participated by all the required people as per the Scrum Guide. The SM has to ensure that the Daily Scrum is conducted regularly and actively participated by the team.
