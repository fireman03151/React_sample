## Velocity

On a Scrum team, you determine the velocity at the end of each Iteration. Velocity is simply the sum of Story Points completed within the timebox.

At the beginning of projects, it is common for velocity to vary from sprint to sprint.  However, the team aligns and becomes more consistent in estimations and delivery, most teams find their velocity becomes more consistent over time.

Having a predictable, consistent velocity allows your team to plan your iterations with some confidence, to work sustainably, and to forecast, with empirical data, the amount of scope to include in each release.
