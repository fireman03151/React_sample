## Meta Scrum
<!-- The article goes here, in GitHub-flavored Markdown. Feel free to add YouTube videos, images, and CodePen/JSBin embeds  -->

A Meta Scrum is a virtual team composed of Product Owners from other scrum teams that are working on different aspects of a larger project. The Product Owners will coordinate Epics, product releases, and product lines. The Meta Scrum can also include company leadership and other key Stakeholders.

The Product Owners that make up the Meta Scrum coordinate Epics and other items in the backlog created by the EAT. They can also work to eliminate impediments that individual scrum masters cannot resolve.

The Meta Scrum aligns priorities across teams by establishing a standardized, recurring forum for communication among teams. Stakeholders and Product Owners should use this virtual team to express preferences and establish product scope/vision rather than approaching individual teams.
