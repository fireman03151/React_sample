It is a family of agile methodologies and includes Crystal Clear, Crystal Yellow, Crystal Orange and others. All of them have unique attributes driven by many factors, like the size of the team, how critical the system is and the priorities of the project. Due to the project's unique characteristics, the state of each project might need a different set of practices, rules, and processes.
