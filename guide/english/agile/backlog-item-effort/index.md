## Backlog Item Effort
Backlog item effort is a rough estimate of the effort required to complete the item in the product backlog.  It is not an estimate of duration.  This effort can be expressed in ideal engineering days or vague alternative units like story points or function points.<sup>[1]</sup>  Estimating the effort should be done by the team.  Each team member can contribute to the estimate based on their perspective and knowlege of the backlog item which may have an effect on the effort involved.<sup>[2]</sup>
