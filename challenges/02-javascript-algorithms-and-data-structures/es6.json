As all major browsers and JavaScript-runtimes follow this specification, the term <i>ECMAScript</i> is interchangeable with the term <i>JavaScript</i>.<br><br>Most of the challenges on freeCodeCamp use the ECMAScript 5 (ES5) specification of the language, finalized in 2009. But JavaScript is an evolving programming language. As features are added and revisions are made, new versions of the language are released for use by developers.<br><br>The most recent standardized version is called ECMAScript 6 (ES6), released in 2015. This new version of the language adds some powerful features that will be covered in this section of challenges, including:<br><br><ul><li>Arrow functions</li><li>Classes</li><li>Modules</li><li>Promises</li><li>Generators</li><li><code>let</code> and <code>const</code></li></ul><br><br><strong>Note</strong><br>Not all browsers support ES6 features.
