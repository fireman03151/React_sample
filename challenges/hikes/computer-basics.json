        "The router would go to the domain name server, still just sending a request.",
        "That server would send back the information that was requested, and it would go back to your device.",
        "You might think this is fallable; if one step goes out, then the whole process is done.",
        "But really, there are so many routers and so many routes that if even a big chunk goes out, that still won't really affect the functionality.",
        "It's really amazing.",
        "What I want you take away from this video is that your device, since it has an IP address, can send out a request for informatoin, and that information will get back to your device via servers and routers that comprise the internet.",
        "Now, this explaination is really quite basic.",
