## Introduction to Learn Parent Graphs and Polynomials

This unit will show you many different types of "parent" graphs, the basic patterns that make up more complicated graphs. Polynomials are mathematical expressions with "multiple things" - the more complicated equations that are built with basic patterns. You will see what these graphs look like, how to modify them, and how to do this all with Python code.
