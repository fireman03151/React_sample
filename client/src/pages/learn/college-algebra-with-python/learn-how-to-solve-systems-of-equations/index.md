## Introduction to Learn How to Solve Systems of Equations

In this unit, you will learn how to solve a system of two equations (with two variables) without graphing. You will see how you can factor an equation and solve for a certain variable in Python. By the end of this unit, you will be able to solve and graph the system with one block of code.
