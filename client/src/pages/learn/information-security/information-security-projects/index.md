## Introduction to the Information Security Projects

Now itâ€™s time to put your newly learned skills to work! By working on these projects, you will have the opportunity of applying all the skills, principles, and concepts from the Information Security sections.

In this section you get the chance to:
* Build a Stock Price Checker
* Build an Anonymous Message Board
* Secure Real Time Multiplayer Game
* Port Scanner
* Packet Capturer

When you are done, you will have plenty of Information Security projects under your belt along with a certification that you can show off to friends, family, and employers. Have fun and remember to use the [Read-Search-Ask](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/t/how-to-get-help-when-you-are-stuck/19514) method if you get stuck.
