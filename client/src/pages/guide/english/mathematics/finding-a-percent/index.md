## Finding a Percent

Percent literally means "out of a hundred" or "per hundred" ("cent" like century). 
<br>A percentage is just a different way of writing a decimal. For example, instead of writing 0.25, we write 25%. Or instead of writing 1.4213, we write 142.13%.  
<br>Percentages are created by moving the decimal point of a decimal two digits to the right and adding a percent sign (%) to the end of the number.

#### Mathematical Operations with Percentages

The simplest way to perform math with percentages is to first convert them to decimals, perform the math, then convert the result back to a percentage.

*Note: Addition and subtraction can be performed without any conversions.*

###### Addition Example

<pre>Consider the problem: 14% + 256%

Simply add the numbers leave the percent sign after the result: 14 + 256 = 270<u>%</u></pre>

###### Multiplication Example

<pre>Consider the problem: 28% * 133%. 

1. Convert the percentages to decimals by moving the decimal point two spaces to the left (0.28 * 1.33)
2. Perform the mathematical operation as you would normally (0.28 * 1.33 = 0.3724)
3. Convert the result back into a percentage by moving the decimal point two spaces to the right (37.24%)</pre>

*Division would follow the same steps.*
