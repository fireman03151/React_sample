## Use Responsive Design with Bootstrap Fluid Containers

Welcome to the Bootstrap challenges, the followingchallenge has you making the existing content children or sub-child of a new div which would be a bootstrap container

### Hint 1

Wrap all HTML code into a single ``` <div></div> ```.

### Hint 2

Use the class of ``` container-fluid ```

```html
<div class="container-fluid>
...
</div>
```

##### NOTE: IN the above solution, the ``` ... ``` represents the HTML which was already present.
