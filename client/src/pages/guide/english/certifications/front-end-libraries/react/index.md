React or ReactJS is a front-end library which is used to create beautiful, reusable and interactive User Interfaces.

React is written in JavaScript and JSX. It is designed with reusability in mind and follows a component based pattern, which means write once and use infinitely.

It is available as a CDN for browser based development or as a npm package for Command line shell based editing.

React has been developed under the Facebook Open Source project, and is actively maintained by the Open Source community.
