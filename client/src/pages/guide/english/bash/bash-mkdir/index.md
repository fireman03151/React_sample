## Bash command: mkdir


**Make a Directory** ,for example `mkdir hello`.

**Creating missing directories in the path**, let's say we need to create a directory `dir` in the path a/b/c/dir, but directory `b` and `c` don't exist. In this case, `mkdir -p a/b/c/dir` will create the missing directories in the path.
