## Logic

Logic in computer science covers the overlap between the field of logic and that of computer science. The topic can essentially be divided into three main areas:

Theoretical foundations and analysis
Use of computer technology to aid logicians
Use of concepts from logic for computer applications

In this section, we'll have guides to a wide variety of logical puzzles that are important to math and programming.
