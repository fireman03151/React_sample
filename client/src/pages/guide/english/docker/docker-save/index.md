## Docker save

`docker save` stores a Docker image to a tar archive. It is useful to make an offline backup of an image or transfer an image to a computer in a corporate environment which does not have a direct access to the Internet.

For example, to save the nginx image already in local computer to a file named `nginx-backup.tar`, the following command can be run:

```
docker save -o nginx-backup.tar nginx
```

Or with a specific version:

```
docker save -o nginx-backup.tar nginx:1.15.5
```
