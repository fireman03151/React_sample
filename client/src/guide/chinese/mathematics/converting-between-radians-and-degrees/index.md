## 在弧度和度数之间转换

### 通用配方

以下公式可用于在弧度和度数之间进行转换：
```
r = d * (π / 180) 
 
 d = r * (180 / π) 
 
 where r is the angle in radians and d is the angle in degrees. 
```

### 例子

将2π/ 3弧度转换为度数：
```
2π/3 * 180/π = 360π/3π = 360/3 = 120 degrees 
```

将30度转换为弧度：
```
30 * π/180 = 30π/180 = π/6 or (1/6)π radians 
 
 Note: Radians are usually expressed in terms of π instead of a rounded decimal as this form represents the actual value rather than an approximation.
