## Version Control System

Version control systems (VCS), also called Source Code Management (SCM), are tools used to track changes on files, manage version and ease collaborative file editing.
There are mainly 2 types of VCS:
- Centralized Version Control System 
Where a central repository is authoritative. The associate architecture is client/server.
The first VCS (CVS, SVN...) were Centralized Version Control System.
- Distributed Version Control System 
Where multiple repository exchange modification. The associate architecture is mostly peer to peer, but one repo can be declared as authoritative.
The most used modern VCS (Git, Mercurial...) are Distributed Version Control System.

## What is Version Control?

Version control, also known as revision or source control, is defined as "the task of keeping a software system consisting of many versions and configurations well organized."

Using [Git](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git) allows for software developers, project managers, and [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) contributors to keep track of changes throughout their [source code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Source_code). Various websites, such as GitHub, GitLab, and Bitbucket allow for better collaboration across time zones and working locations.

In addition to tracking changes, there are numerous benefits of using version control on your next project. For example, version control allows you to branch out your code with commits (save changes locally) without compromising the original code (master branch).

## Why use it?

- **Changes history** - VCS enable the user to browse and search all the changes which are automatically recorded with useful information (date, author, etc.) and the ability to revert those changes whenever necessary.
- **Versions/tags** - The user can search/retrieve specific state of the files that have been labeled with tags and version names.
- **Branching/Merging** - Distributed Version Control System make it easy to maintain parallel branch of files and to merge them partially or totally when needed.
- **Atomic operations** - All modern VCS provide atomic operations: All modifications are guaranteed to succeed or fail as whole which ensure that the files are always in a consistent state.

## Most popular Version Control System

- Git

*Git* is a Distributed Version Control System and probably the most used VCS used nowadays with *Mercurial*.

- Mercurial

*Mercurial* is a Distributed Version Control System and probably the most used VCS used nowadays with *Git*.

- CVS

*CVS* is an old SCM which was proeminent before *SVN* widespread.
*CVS* and *SVN* are now deprecated in favor of Distributed Version Control System like *Git* and *Mercurial*.

- SVN/Subversion

*SVM* is an old SCM that succeeded *CVS*.
Eventually *SVN* was deprecated by the wide adoption of Distributed Version Control System like *Git* and *Mercurial*
