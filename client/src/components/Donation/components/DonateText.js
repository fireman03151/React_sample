      <p>freeCodeCamp is a highly efficient education nonprofit.</p>
      <p>
        In 2019 alone, we provided 1,100,000,000 minutes of free education to
        people around the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since freeCodeCamp's total budget is only $373,000, that means every
        dollar you donate to freeCodeCamp translates into 50 hours worth of
        technology education.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you donate to freeCodeCamp, you help people learn new skills and
        provide for their families.
      </p>
      <p>
        You also help us create new resources for you to use to expand your own
        technology skills.
      </p>
    </>
