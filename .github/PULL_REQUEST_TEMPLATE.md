## FreeCodeCamp Pull Request template
Please, go through steps before you submit a PR.

1. Make sure that your PR is not a duplicate.
2. If not then:

  2.1. Make sure you've done your changes in a separate branch, like `fix/signin-issue` or `feature/issue-templates`.

  2.2. You have a descriptive commit message.

  2.3. You have only one commit (if not, [squash](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/git-rebase#squashing-multiple-commits-into-one) them into one commit).

  2.4. Make sure `npm test` doesn't throw any error. If it does, fix them first and amend your commit.

3. **After** these steps you're ready to open a pull request. ***Don't*** forget to remove this template first.

  3.1. Give a descriptive title to your PR.

  3.2. Provide a description of your changes.

  3.3. Put `closes #XXXX` in your comment to auto-close the issue that your PR fixes (if such).
