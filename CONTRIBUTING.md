#### Research, Write and Update our guide articles

**What are Guide articles?**

Guide articles help you get a quick understanding of a technology concept. These are short, plain-English explanations that you can read before going on to more in-depth resources.

You can find an [example article about HTML Elements here](./client/src/pages/html/elements/index.md).

**What can I write an article about?**

We welcome your help writing these articles. You don't have to be an expert in a topic to write about it‚Äîthis entire Guide is open source, so even if you make a mistake, another contributor will eventually correct it.

To help, find a `stub article` on our [Guide website](https://www.freecodecamp.org/guide), write the article, then open a pull request to replace the stub with your article. A [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) is how you'll suggest changes. It lets others know about your changes, review them and adopt them.

If you can't find a stub about the topic you'd like to write about, you can open a PR that creates the stub and includes your draft article.

If you would like work on these, follow along these guidelines:

### [How to work on Guide articles.](/docs/how-to-work-on-guide-articles.md)

#### Create, Update and Fix Bugs in our coding challenges

**[TODO]**

### [How to work on Coding Challenges.](/docs/how-to-work-on-coding-challenges.md)

#### Translate guide articles and coding challenges

You can help us translate our Guide articles and Coding challenges for a language that you speak. Currently we have translated versions in:

- Chinese (‰∏≠Êñá)
- Russian (—Ä—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–π)
- Arabic (ÿπÿ±ÿ®Ÿâ)
- Spanish (Espa√±ol)
- Portuguese (Portugu√™s)

Most of these versions are machine translated. We would love your help in improving the quality of these translations.

**If you would like work on these, follow along these steps:**

**[TODO]** We are in the process of updating docs for translation. [Follow this issue for the progress]().

#### Help us fix bugs in freeCodeCamp.org's learning platform

Our learning platform runs on a modern JavaScript stack. It has various components, tools and libraries including but not limited to Node.js, MongoDB, LoopBack, OAuth 2.0, React, Gatsby, Webpack, and more.

Broadly,

- We have a Node.js based API server.
- A set of React based client applications.
- A script that we use to use our Frontend projects.

Contributing to this requires some understanding of APIs, ES6 Syntax and a lot of curiosity.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**How can I report a bug, that is not on board?**

If you think you've found a bug, first read the ["Help I've Found a Bug"](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-report-a-bug/19543) article and follow its instructions.

If you're confident it's a new bug, go ahead and create a new GitHub issue. Be sure to include as much information as possible so we can reproduce the bug. We have a pre-defined issue template to help you through this.

Please note, that any issues that seek coding help on a challenge, will be closed. The issue tracker is strictly for the codebase related issues and discussions. You should [seek assistance on the forum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum) before reporting whenever in doubt.

**How can I report a security issue?**

Please don't create GitHub issues for security issues. Instead, please send an email to `security@freecodecamp.org` and we'll look into it immediately.

**I am stuck on something that is not in these documentation. How can get help?**

Feel free to ask for help in:

- [The "Contributors" category our public forum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/c/contributors).
- [Our public contributors chat room on Gitter](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Contributors).

We are excited to help you contribute to any of the topics that you would like to work on. Make sure you search for your query before posting a new one. Be polite and patient. Our community volunteers and moderators are always around to guide you through your queries.

**I am new to GitHub and Open Source in general:**

Read our [How to Contribute to Open Source Guide](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/how-to-contribute-to-open-source).

**What do these different labels mean, that are tagged on issues?**

Our community moderators [triage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#Bug_management) issues and pull requests based on their priority, severity and other factors. You can [find a complete glossary of their meanings here](https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/labels). You should go through **`Help Wanted`** or **`first timers welcome`** issues for quick lookup of what is available for you to work on.

**I found a typo, should I report an issue before I can make a pull request?**

You can straight away create a pull request without having to report any issues, for typos, or small changes to [verbiage](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/verbiage). Issues are a tool to seek confirmation on  changes that you would want to propose via a pull request.
