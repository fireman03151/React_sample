### 1. Contribute to this open source codebase

We have a huge open source codebase of the thousands of [Curriculum challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) and [Guide articles](https://www.freecodecamp.org/guide). These challenges and articles make up the learning content available on the freeCodeCamp.org's learning platform.

#### üìñ Research, Write and Update our guide articles

##### What are Guide articles?

The Guide articles aim to be short articles to get you started and familiar with these concepts before going on to read more in-depth material.

Guide articles can be an explanation of a syntax, design pattern, what aria labels are for, or something like what the numbers mean in the top right-hand corner of your screen when at [freecodecamp.org](https://freecodecamp.org).

You can find an [example article about HTML Elements here](./client/src/pages/html/elements/index.md).

##### What can I write an article about?

Front-end development (adjective form with a dash) is when you are working on the front end (noun form with no dash). The same goes with the back end, full stack, and many other compound terms.

We welcome your help writing these articles. You don't have to be an expert in a topic to write about it‚Äîthis entire Guide is open source, so even if you make a mistake, another contributor will eventually correct it.

To help, find a `stub article` on our [Guide website](https://www.freecodecamp.org/guide), write the article, then open a pull request (PR) to replace the stub with your article. A [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) is how you'll suggest changes. It lets others know about your changes, review them and adopt them.

If you can't find a stub about the topic you'd like to write about, you can open a PR that creates the stub and includes your draft article.

#### üõ† Help us fix bugs in freeCodeCamp.org's learning platform

Our learning platform runs on a modern JavaScript stack. It has various components, tools and libraries including but not limited to Node.js, MongoDB, LoopBack, OAuth 2.0, React, Gatsby, Webpack, and more.

Broadly,

- We have a Node.js based API server.
- A set of React based client applications.
- A script that we use to use our Frontend projects.

Contributing to this requires some understanding of APIs, ES6 Syntax and a lot of curiosity.

## FAQs

**I found a bug that is not on the board. Where and when should I report?**

If you think you've found a bug, first read the ["Help I've Found a Bug"](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-report-a-bug/19543) article and follow its instructions.

If you're confident it's a new bug, go ahead and create a new GitHub issue. Be sure to include as much information as possible so we can reproduce the bug. We have a pre-defined issue template to help you through this.

Please note, that any issues that seek coding help on a challenge, will be closed. The issue tracker is strictly for the codebase related issues and discussions. You should [seek assistance on the forum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum) before reporting whenever in doubt.

**I found a security issue:**

Please don't create GitHub issues for security issues. Instead, please send an email to `security@freecodecamp.org` and we'll look into it immediately.

**I am stuck on a step while contributing and need help:**

Feel free to ask for help in:

- [The "Contributors" category our public forum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum/c/contributors).
- [Our public contributors chat room on Gitter](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/Contributors).

We are excited to help you contribute to any of the topics that you would like to work on. Make sure you search for your query before posting a new one. Be polite and patient. Our community volunteers and moderators are always around to guide you through your queries.

**I am new to GitHub and Open Source in general:**

- You can learn how from this *free* series ["How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub"](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github) - by [Kent C. Dodds](https://github.com/kentcdodds)
- Checkout <https://www.firsttimersonly.com>, a great resource on finding issues to contribute to as a first timer.

**I dont understand the different labels on the issues and pull requests:**

Our community moderators [triage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#Bug_management) issues and pull requests based on their priority, severity and other factors. You can [find a complete glossary of their meanings here](https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/labels). You should go through **`Help Wanted`** or **`first timers welcome`** issues for quick lookup of what is available for you to work on.

**I found a typo, should I report an Issue before I can make a pull request?**

You can straight away create a pull request without having to report any issues, for typos, or small changes to [verbiage](https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/verbiage). Issues are a tool to seek confirmation on  changes that you would want to propose via a pull request.
