We're getting a lot of duplicate issues and bug reports that just aren't reporting actual bugs.
So, before you submit your issue, please read the [Help I've Found a Bug](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Help-I've-Found-a-Bug) wiki page.

We welcome pull requests from Free Code Camp campers (our students) and seasoned JavaScript developers alike! Follow these steps to contribute:

1.  Check our [public Waffle Board](https://waffle.io/freecodecamp/freecodecamp).
2.  Pick an issue that nobody has claimed and start working on it. If your issue isn't on the board, open an issue. If you think you can fix it yourself, start working on it. Feel free to ask for help in our [Gitter](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp).
3.  Fork the project ([Need help with forking a project?](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/)). You'll do all of your work on your forked copy.
4.  Create a branch specific to the issue or feature you are working on. Push your work to that branch. ([Need help with branching?](https://github.com/Kunena/Kunena-Forum/wiki/Create-a-new-branch-with-git-and-manage-branches))
5.  Name the branch something like `fix/xxx` or `feature/xxx` where `xxx` is a short description of the changes or feature you are attempting to add. For example `fix/email-login` would be a branch where I fix something specific to email login.
6.  You should have [ESLint running in your editor](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/integrations.html), and it will highlight anything doesn't conform to [Free Code Camp's JavaScript Style Guide](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Free-Code-Camp-JavaScript-Style-Guide) (you can find a summary of those rules [here](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/blob/staging/.eslintrc). Please do not ignore any linting errors, as they are meant to **help** you and to ensure a clean and simple code base. Make sure none of your JavaScript is longer than 80 characters per line.
7.  Once your code is ready, submit a [pull request](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/Pull-Request-Contribute) from your branch to Free Code Camp's `staging` branch. We'll do a quick code review and give you feedback, then iterate from there. It may also be helpful to read about git [rebasing](https://github.com/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp/wiki/git-rebase).
