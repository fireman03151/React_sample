# Frequently Asked Questions

Answers to common questions.

## I am new to GitHub and Open Source. Where should I start?

Read our ["How to Contribute to Open Source Guide"](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/how-to-contribute-to-open-source). It's a comprehensive reference for first-timer-friendly projects. And it includes a lot of open-source contribution tips.

## What do I need to know to contribute to the codebase?

freeCodeCamp runs on a modern JavaScript stack. If you're interested in contributing to our codebase, you will need some familiarity with JavaScript and some of the technologies we use like Node.js, MongoDB, OAuth 2.0, React, Gatsby, and Webpack.

## Can I translate freeCodeCamp's resources?

Yes - You can contribute to any of the 30+ languages we have enabled on our translation platform.

We have user-contributed translations live in some languages. We intend to localize freeCodeCamp into several major world languages. You can read all about this in our [announcement here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/help-translate-freecodecamp-language/).

If you are interested in contributing to translations please make sure you [read this guide](how-to-translate-files.md) first.

## Can I contribute articles to freeCodeCamp News or videos to freeCodeCamp's YouTube channel?

Yes - you can contribute to our publication blog and YouTube channel.

## How can I report a new bug?

If you think you've found a bug, first read the ["How to Report a Bug"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-report-a-bug-to-freecodecamp/) article and follow its instructions.

If you're confident it's a new bug, go ahead and create a new GitHub issue. Be sure to include as much information as possible so that we can reproduce the bug. We have a pre-defined issue template to help you through this.

Please note that these GitHub issues are for codebase-related issues and discussions – not for getting help with learning to code. Whenever in doubt, you should [seek assistance on the forum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org) before creating a GitHub issue.

## How can I report a security issue?

Please don't create GitHub issues for security issues. Instead, please [follow our security policy](https://contribute.freecodecamp.org/#/security).

## I am a student. Can I work on a feature for academic credits?

Yes. Please note we are unable to commit to any timelines or paperwork that may be a requirement by your college or university. We receive many pull-requests and code contributions from volunteer developers, and we respect their time and efforts. Out of respect for all of our other contributors, we will not give any PR special priority just because it happens to be school-related.

We request you to plan ahead and work on code contributions with this in mind.

## What do these different labels that are tagged on issues mean?

The code maintainers [triage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#Bug_management) issues and pull requests based on their priority, severity, and other factors. You can [find a complete glossary of their meanings here](https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/labels).

## Where do I start if I want to work on an issue?

You should go through [**`help wanted`**](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) or [**`first timers only`**](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22first+timers+only%22) issues for a quick overview of what is available for you to work on.

> [!TIP] Você não precisa pedir permissão para ajudar com issues marcadas como **`help wanted`**. No entanto, issues com a etiqueta **`first timers only`** são issues especiais projetadas para pessoas que não contribuíram antes para a base de código freeCodeCamp.

## I found a typo. Should I report an issue before I can make a pull request?

For typos and other wording changes, you can directly open pull requests without creating an issue first. Please be sure to mention details in the pull request description to help us understand and review your contribution – even if it's just a minor change.

Please do create an issue if you want to discuss bigger aspects of the codebase or curriculum.

## How can I get an issue assigned to me?

We typically do not assign issues to anyone other than long-time contributors. Instead, we follow the below policy to be fair to everyone:

1. É muito provável que façamos o merge do primeiro pull request que resolve a issue.
2. No caso de vários colaboradores abrindo um pull request para a mesma issue, ao mesmo tempo, daremos prioridade ao pull request que melhor resolve a issue. Algumas coisas que consideramos:
   - Você incluiu testes?
   - Você usou todos os casos de uso?
   - Você garantiu que todos os testes passaram e confirmou que tudo está funcionando localmente?
3. Por último, damos prioridade aos pull requests que seguem as nossas orientações recomendadas.
   - Você seguiu a checklist do pull request?
   - Você deu um título significativo ao seu pull request?

## I am interested in being a moderator at freeCodeCamp. Where should I start?

Our community moderators are our heroes. Their voluntary contributions make freeCodeCamp a safe and welcoming community.

First and foremost, we would need you to be an active participant in the community, and live by our [code of conduct](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/code-of-conduct/) (not just enforce it).

Here are some recommended paths for some of our platforms:

- Para ser um moderador do **Discord/Chat**, tenha uma presença ativa em nosso chat e compromissos positivos com os outros, ao mesmo tempo em que aprende e pratica como lidar com conflitos em potencial que possam surgir.
- Para ser um moderador do **fórum**, similar a um moderador de chat, tenha uma presença ativa e interaja com as outras pessoas que publicam no fórum, apoie-os em sua jornada de aprendizado e dê feedback quando perguntarem. Dê uma olhada no [Manual do líder do subfórum](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/the-subforum-leader-handbook/326326) para obter mais informações.
- Para ser um moderador do **GitHub**, ajude a processar as issues levantadas no GitHub para ver se elas são válidas e (idealmente) tente propor soluções para essas issues a serem resolvidas por outras pessoas (ou por você mesmo).

Altogether, be respectful to others. We are humans from all around the world. With that in mind, please also consider using encouraging or supportive language and be mindful of cross-cultural communication.

If you practice the above **consistently for a while** and our fellow moderator members recommend you, a staff member will reach out and onboard you to the moderators' team. Open source work is voluntary work and our time is limited. We acknowledge that this is probably true in your case as well. So we emphasize being **consistent** rather than engaging in the community 24/7.

Take a look at our [Moderator Handbook](moderator-handbook.md) for a more exhaustive list of other responsibilities and expectations we have of our moderators.

## I am stuck on something that is not included in this documentation.

**Feel free to ask for help in:**

- A categoria `Contributors` do [fórum da nossa comunidade](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/contributors).
- O canal `#Contributors` em nosso [servidor](https://discord.gg/PRyKn3Vbay).

We are excited to help you contribute to any of the topics that you would like to work on. If you ask us questions on the related issue threads, we will be glad to clarify. Be sure to search for your question before posting a new one.

Thanks in advance for being polite and patient. Remember – this community is run mainly by volunteers.
