# How to catch outgoing emails locally (for email workflows)

> **Note:** This is an **optional** step - Only required when working with email workflows

## Introduction


Some of the email workflows, like updating a user's email, require the back-end api-server to send out emails. While developing, you can use a tool to catch these emails locally instead of having to use an email provider and send an actual email. MailHog is one such email testing tool for developers that will catch the emails your local freeCodeCamp instance is sending.

## Installing MailHog

How you install and run MailHog is dependent upon your OS:

- [Installing MailHog on macOS](#installing-mailhog-on-macos)
- [Installing MailHog on Windows](#installing-mailhog-on-windows)
- [Installing MailHog on Linux](#installing-mailhog-on-linux)

### Installing MailHog on macOS

Here is how to set up MailHog on macOS with [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):

```bash
brew install mailhog
brew services start mailhog
```

This will start a mailhog service in the background.

Next, you can go to [using MailHog](#using-mailhog).

### Installing MailHog on Windows

Download the latest MailHog version from [MailHog's official repository](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog/releases). Click on the link for your Windows version (32 or 64 bit) and the .exe file will be downloaded to your computer.

Once it finishes downloading, click on the file. You might get a Windows firewall notification where you will have to allow access to MailHog. Once you do, a standard Windows command line prompt will open with MailHog already running.

To close MailHog, close the command prompt. To run it again, click on the same .exe file. You don't need to download a new one.

Next, you can go to [using MailHog](#using-mailhog).

### Installing MailHog on Linux

First, install [Go](https://golang.org).

For Debian-based systems like Ubuntu and Linux Mint, run:

```bash
sudo apt-get install golang
```

For CentOS, Fedora, Red Hat Linux, and other RPM-based systems, run:

```bash
sudo dnf install golang
```

Or:

```bash
sudo yum install golang
```

Set the path for Go:

```bash
echo "export GOPATH=$HOME/go" >> ~/.profile
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin:$GOPATH/bin' >> ~/.profile
source ~/.profile
```

Then install and run MailHog:

```bash
go get github.com/mailhog/MailHog
sudo cp /home/$(whoami)/go/bin/MailHog /usr/local/bin/mailhog
mailhog
```

Next, you can go to [using MailHog](#using-mailhog).

## Using MailHog

Once you have installed MailHog and started it running, you need to open your MailHog inbox in your browser. Open a new tab or window and navigate to [http://localhost:8025](http://localhost:8025).
You should now see a screen like below:

When your freeCodeCamp installation sends an email, you will see it appear here. Like below:

![MailHog Screenshot 2](images/mailhog/2.jpg)

Open the mail.  You should see two tabs where you can view the content - plain text and source. Make sure you are on the plain text tab.

Any links in the email should be clickable.
