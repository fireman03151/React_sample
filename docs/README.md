> ### Our contributing guidelines are available here: <https://contribute.freecodecamp.org>

Looking to edit the contributing guidelines? The source is [available here](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/tree/master/docs).

They are created using [docsify](https://docsify.js.org). The guideline homepage's source is [index.html](index.html), which generates the page from the content in [index.md](index.md).

To run the docs locally, install `docsify`

```bash
npm i -g docsify
```

and then use

```bash
docsify serve docs
```
