## Contribute to our open source codebase

Our codebase has thousands of [coding challenges](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/) and other source code that power our learning platform.

### Coding Challenges

All our coding challenges are curated by the community, bringing in expert knowledge from volunteers like you.

You can help expand them and make their wording better. You can also update the user stories to explain the concept better or remove redundant ones and improve the challenge tests to make them more accurately test people's code.

**If you're interested in improving these coding challenges, here's [how to work on coding challenges](how-to-work-on-coding-challenges.md).**

### Learning Platform

Our learning platform runs on a modern JavaScript stack. It has various components, tools, and libraries, including but not limited to, Node.js, MongoDB, LoopBack, OAuth 2.0, React, Gatsby, Webpack, and more.

Broadly,

- We have a Node.js based API server.
- A set of React-based client applications.
- A script that we use to evaluate our front-end projects.

Contributing to this requires some understanding of APIs, ES6 Syntax, and a lot of curiosity.

Essentially, we expect basic familiarity with some of the aforementioned technologies, tools, and libraries. With that being said, you are not required to be an expert on them to contribute.

**If you want to help us improve our codebase, you can either [set up freeCodeCamp locally](how-to-setup-freecodecamp-locally.md)**

OR

**Use Gitpod, a free online dev environment.**

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Where are the Guide articles (guide.freecodecamp.org)?

We will not have the general guide articles anymore.

We intend to publish these as tutorials that are curated by the editorial team. These would then be published by them on the Developer News.

The challenge hints and articles will still be available on the forum which we have already migrated.

### Can I translate freeCodeCamp's curriculum?

At the minute we are translating the curriculum to Chinese _only_.

While we do intend to make the curriculum available in more languages, right now we do not have a timeline for this.

China is one of the largest demographic regions in terms of our non-english audience. It is an ideal candidate for the internationalization (i18n). We currently have hundreds of thousands of users using an old version of the platform.

Once we have ironed out the logistics with the Chinese version of our curriculum, the next languages to follow would be _Arabic, Portuguese, Russian and Spanish_ in no particular order. For Portuguese and Spanish we will focus on Latin America as our target demographic region based on the audience we have.

While you may work on the translations, we are unable to launch them until later next year, other than Chinese which is tentatively planned for a early 2020 release. We may accept pull requests (high quality human translations only), depending on a case to case basis.

### Can I translate freeCodeCamp's codebase documentation?

You are welcome to translate freeCodeCamp's codebase documentation into any language of your choice or improve and update the currently translated guidelines.

### How can I report a bug that is not on board?

If you think you've found a bug, first read the ["Help I've Found a Bug"](https://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-report-a-bug/19543) article and follow its instructions.

If you're confident it's a new bug, go ahead and create a new GitHub issue. Be sure to include as much information as possible so that we can reproduce the bug. We have a pre-defined issue template to help you through this.

Please note that any issues that seek coding help on a challenge will be closed. The issue tracker is strictly for codebase related issues and discussions. Whenever in doubt, you should [seek assistance on the forum](https://www.freecodecamp.org/forum) before making a report.

### How can I report a security issue?

Please don't create GitHub issues for security issues. Instead, please send an email to `security@freecodecamp.org` and we'll look into it immediately.

### What do these different labels that are tagged on issues mean?

Our community moderators [triage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug#Bug_management) issues and pull requests based on their priority, severity, and other factors. You can [find a complete glossary of their meanings here](https://github.com/freecodecamp/freecodecamp/labels).

You should go through [**`help wanted`**](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22help+wanted%22) or [**`first timers welcome`**](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22first+timers+welcome%22) issues for a quick overview of what is available for you to work on.

These are up for grabs, and you do not need to seek permission before working on them. If these issues lack clarity on what needs to be done, feel free to ask questions in the comments.

### I found a typo, should I report an issue before I can make a pull request?

For typos and other wording changes, you can directly open pull requests without creating an issue first. Issues are more for discussing larger problems associated with code or structural aspects of the curriculum.

However, please mention details, context etc. in the pull request's description area to help us understand and review your contribution even for minor changes.

### How do I get an issue assigned to me?

We typically do not assign issues to anyone other than long-time contributors to avoid ambiguous no-shows. Instead, we follow the below policy to be fair to everyone:

1. The first pull request for any issue is preferred to be merged.
2. In the case of multiple pull requests for the same issue, we give priority to the quality of the code in the pull requests.
   - Did you include tests?
   - Did you catch all usecases?
   - Did you ensure all tests pass, and you confirmed everything works locally?
3. Finally, we favor pull requests which follow our recommended guidelines.
   - Did you follow the pull request checklist?
   - Did you name your pull request title meaningfully?

You do not need any permission for issues that are marked `help wanted` or `first timers welcome` as explained earlier.

Follow the guidelines carefully and open a pull request.

### I am new to GitHub and Open Source, where should I start?
