# How to help with video challenges

Video challenges are a new type of challenge in the freeCodeCamp curriculum. They are currently only in beta and not available yet on freeCodeCamp.org.

A video challenge is a small section of a full-length video course on a particular topic. A video challenge page embeds a YouTube video. Each challenge page has a single multiple-choice question related to the video. A user must answer the question correctly before moving on the the next video challenge in the course.

The video challenge pages are created by members of the freeCodeCamp team. YouTube videos are also uploaded by members of the freeCodeCamp team. Many of the video challenges do not yet have questions associated with them.

You can help by creating multiple choice questions related to video sections and adding the questions to the markdown files for the video challenges.


## Challenge Template

Below is a template of what the challenge markdown files look like.

````md
---
id: Unique identifier (alphanumerical, MongoDB_id)
title: Challenge Title
challengeType: 11
videoId: 'YouTube videoId for video challenge'
---

## Description

<section id='description'>
An optional description with helpful information related to the video.
</section>

## Tests

<section id='tests'>

```yml
question:
  text: 'Question'
  answers:
    - 'Answer One'
    - 'Answer Two'
    - 'Answer Three'
  solution: 3
```

</section>

## Creating questions for video challenges

### Access the video challenge markdown files

You can find the markdown files for video challenges at the following locations in the curriculum:

- [Data Analysis with Python Course](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/tree/next-python-projects/curriculum/challenges/english/08-data-analysis-with-python/data-analysis-with-python-course)
- [TensorFlow 2.0 Course](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/tree/next-python-projects/curriculum/challenges/english/11-machine-learning-with-python/tensorflow)
- [Numpy Course](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/tree/next-python-projects/curriculum/challenges/english/08-data-analysis-with-python/numpy)
- [How Neural Networks Work Course](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/tree/next-python-projects/curriculum/challenges/english/11-machine-learning-with-python/how-neural-networks-work)

Pick a challenge markdown file from the options above.

### Skim through the video associated with the challenge and create a mutiple choice question

First, find the videoId.

For example, in the following code from the header of a video challenge markdown file, the videoId is "nVAaxZ34khk". On GitHub, the information could be layed out in a table format.
```
---
id: 5e9a093a74c4063ca6f7c14d
title: Data Analysis Example A
challengeType: 11
videoId: nVAaxZ34khk
---
```

Next, access the YouTube video with that videoId. The url for the video will be:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=[videoId]    (add in the videoId to the URL)

In the example above, the url is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nVAaxZ34khk .

Skim the YouTube video with that videoId and think of a multiple choice question based on the content of the video.

### Add the question to the markdown file

You can add the question locally or directly throught the GitHub interface. To add the question locally, you need to [set up freeCodeCamp locally](how-to-setup-freecodecamp-locally.md). You can also find the file on GitHub and click the edit button to add the question right in your browser.

If a question has not yet been added to a particular video challenge, it will have the following default question:

```yml
question:
  text: |
    Question
  answers:
    - |
      one
    - |
      two
    - |
      three
  solution: 3
```

Update the word “Question” with your question. Update the “one”, “two”, and “three” with the possible answers. Make sure to update the solution number with which answer is correct. You can add more possible answers using the same format. The question and answers can be surrounded with quotation marks.

#### Use markdown to format your question

The text in the question is parsed as markdown. The simplest way to ensure that it is formatted correctly is to start the question with `text: |`, like this:

```yml
question:
  text: |
    Question
```

Then you need to make sure that your question is on a new line and indented one level more than `text: |`.

The same approach can be used for the answers, so the entire question becomes

```yml
question:
  text: |
    Question
  answers:
  - |
    First answer
  - |
    Second
  - |
    Third
  solution: 2
```

Make sure each answer is plausible but there is only one correct answer.

#### Use of HTML

Questions and answers can contain certain HTML tags like `<br>` for a new line. HTML tags should be used sparingly, when questions cannot be expressed without them.

### Question examples

#### Examples without HTML

````yml
question:
  text: |
    What does this JavaScript code log to the console?
    ```js
    console.log('hello world');
    ```

    Select an answer!
  answers:
    - |
      hello *world*
    - |
      **hello** world
    - |
      hello world
  solution: 3
````

````yml
question:
  text: |
    What will print out after running this code:
    ```py
    width = 15
    height = 12.0
    print(height/3)
    ```
  answers:
    - |
      39
    - |
      4
    - |
      4.0
    - |
      5.0
    - |
      5
  solution: 3
````

#### Example with HTML

```yml
question:
  text: |
    What will print out after running this code:
    <pre><code>width = 15<br>height = 12.0<br>print(height/3)<code></pre>
  answers:
    - |
      39
    - |
      4
    - |
      4.0
    - |
      5.0
    - |
      5
  solution: 3
```

The final example demonstrates that HTML can be used, but that it is not as readable as the version without it.

For more examples, you can look at the markdown files for the following video course.

## Open a pull request

After creating one or more questions, you can commit the changes to a new branch and [open a pull request](how-to-open-a-pull-request.md).
