            <hr>
            <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At Free Code Camp we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
            <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
            <li>Unless you ask us not to (by clicking the button that says "hide all my solutions from other people" located on your code portfolio), we will share your solutions and progress with the public as part of our open data initiative. This is intended for academics and researchers to better understand Free Code Camp as an educational model.</li>
            <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
            <li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted. Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please email us at <a mailto="team@freecodecamp.com">team@freecodecamp.com</a></p>
            <p>Free Code Camp Inc. (“<strong>Free Code Camp</strong>”) operates several websites including <a href="http://FreeCodeCamp.com/">FreeCodeCamp.com</a>. It is Free Code Camp’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
            <h3><a id="Website_Visitors_19"></a>Website Visitors</h3>
            <p>Like most website operators, Free Code Camp collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. Free Code Camp’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Free Code Camp’s visitors use its website. From time to time, Free Code Camp may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
            <p>Free Code Camp also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on <a href="http://FreeCodeCamp.com">FreeCodeCamp.com</a> blogs. Free Code Camp only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>
            <h3><a id="Gathering_of_PersonallyIdentifying_Information_25"></a>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
            <p>Many visitors to Free Code Camp’s websites choose to interact with Free Code Camp in ways that require Free Code Camp to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Free Code Camp gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who create an account for tracking their progress at <a href="http://FreeCodeCamp.com/">FreeCodeCamp.com</a> to provide either an email address or sign in with a social media oauth service like GitHub. Those who engage in transactions with Free Code Camp – by placing job ads, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, Free Code Camp collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with Free Code Camp. Free Code Camp does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
            <h3><a id="Aggregated_Statistics_29"></a>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
            <p>Free Code Camp may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, Free Code Camp may monitor the accounts to try and identify spammers. Free Code Camp may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, Free Code Camp does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
            <h3><a id="Protection_of_Certain_PersonallyIdentifying_Information_33"></a>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
            <p>Free Code Camp discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on Free Code Camp’s behalf or to provide services available at Free Code Camp’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using Free Code Camp’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. Free Code Camp will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, Free Code Camp discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when Free Code Camp believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Free Code Camp, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an Free Code Camp website and have supplied your email address, Free Code Camp may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with Free Code Camp and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. Free Code Camp takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

            <h3><a id="Business_Transfers_41"></a>Business Transfers</h3>
            <p>If Free Code Camp, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that Free Code Camp goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of Free Code Camp may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>

These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you.
