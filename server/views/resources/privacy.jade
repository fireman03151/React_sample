            <hr>
            <p>Your privacy is critically important to us. At freeCodeCamp we have a few fundamental principles:</p>
            <ol>
            <li>We don’t ask you for personal information unless we truly need it. (We can’t stand services that ask you for things like your gender or income level for no apparent reason.)</li>
            <li>We don’t share your personal information with anyone except to comply with the law, develop our products, or protect our rights.</li>
            <li>Unless you ask us not to (by clicking the button that says "hide all my solutions from other people" located on your code portfolio), we will share your solutions and progress with the public as part of our open data initiative. This is intended for academics and researchers to better understand freeCodeCamp as an educational model.</li>
            <li>We don’t store personal information on our servers unless required for the on-going operation of one of our services.</li>
            <li>We aim to make it as simple as possible for you to control what’s visible to the public, seen by search engines, kept private, and permanently deleted. Below is our privacy policy which incorporates these goals</li>
            </ol>
            <p>If you have questions about deleting or correcting your personal data please email us at <a mailto="team@freecodecamp.com">team@freecodecamp.com</a></p>
            <p>freeCodeCamp Inc. (“<strong>freeCodeCamp</strong>”) operates several websites including <a href="http://freeCodeCamp.com/">freeCodeCamp.com</a>. It is freeCodeCamp’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our websites.</p>
            <h3><a id="Website_Visitors_19"></a>Website Visitors</h3>
            <p>Like most website operators, freeCodeCamp collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. freeCodeCamp’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how freeCodeCamp’s visitors use its website. From time to time, freeCodeCamp may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.</p>
            <p>freeCodeCamp also collects potentially personally-identifying information like Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users and for users leaving comments on <a href="http://freeCodeCamp.com">freeCodeCamp.com</a> blogs. freeCodeCamp only discloses logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that blog commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog where the comment was left.</p>
            <h3><a id="Gathering_of_PersonallyIdentifying_Information_25"></a>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
            <p>Many visitors to freeCodeCamp’s websites choose to interact with freeCodeCamp in ways that require freeCodeCamp to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that freeCodeCamp gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who create an account for tracking their progress at <a href="http://freeCodeCamp.com/">freeCodeCamp.com</a> to provide either an email address or sign in with a social media oauth service like GitHub. Those who engage in transactions with freeCodeCamp – by placing job ads, for example – are asked to provide additional information, including as necessary the personal and financial information required to process those transactions. In each case, freeCodeCamp collects such information only insofar as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the purpose of the visitor’s interaction with freeCodeCamp. freeCodeCamp does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below. And visitors can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain website-related activities.</p>
            <h3><a id="Aggregated_Statistics_29"></a>Aggregated Statistics</h3>
            <p>freeCodeCamp may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its websites. For instance, freeCodeCamp may monitor the accounts to try and identify spammers. freeCodeCamp may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, freeCodeCamp does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.</p>
            <h3><a id="Protection_of_Certain_PersonallyIdentifying_Information_33"></a>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h3>
            <p>freeCodeCamp discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only to those of its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations that (i) need to know that information in order to process it on freeCodeCamp’s behalf or to provide services available at freeCodeCamp’s websites, and (ii) that have agreed not to disclose it to others. Some of those employees, contractors and affiliated organizations may be located outside of your home country; by using freeCodeCamp’s websites, you consent to the transfer of such information to them. freeCodeCamp will not rent or sell potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information to anyone. Other than to its employees, contractors and affiliated organizations, as described above, freeCodeCamp discloses potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information only in response to a subpoena, court order or other governmental request, or when freeCodeCamp believes in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of freeCodeCamp, third parties or the public at large. If you are a registered user of an freeCodeCamp website and have supplied your email address, freeCodeCamp may occasionally send you an email to tell you about new features, solicit your feedback, or just keep you up to date with what’s going on with freeCodeCamp and our products. We primarily use our various product blogs to communicate this type of information, so we expect to keep this type of email to a minimum. If you send us a request (for example via a support email or via one of our feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish it in order to help us clarify or respond to your request or to help us support other users. freeCodeCamp takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>
            <h3><a id="Cookies_37"></a>Cookies</h3>
            <p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor’s computer, and that the visitor’s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. freeCodeCamp uses cookies to help freeCodeCamp identify and track visitors, their usage of freeCodeCamp website, and their website access preferences. freeCodeCamp visitors who do not wish to have cookies placed on their computers should set their browsers to refuse cookies before using freeCodeCamp’s websites, with the drawback that certain features of freeCodeCamp’s websites may not function properly without the aid of cookies.</p>
            <h3><a id="Business_Transfers_41"></a>Business Transfers</h3>
            <p>If freeCodeCamp, or substantially all of its assets, were acquired, or in the unlikely event that freeCodeCamp goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of freeCodeCamp may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.</p>
            <h3><a id="Ads_45"></a>Ads</h3>
            <p>If in the future we show ads, ads appearing on any of our websites may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by freeCodeCamp and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.</p>
            <h3><a id="Privacy_Policy_Changes_53"></a>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
            <p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, freeCodeCamp may change its Privacy Policy from time to time, and in freeCodeCamp’s sole discretion. freeCodeCamp encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If you have a <a href="http://freeCodeCamp.com">freeCodeCamp.com</a> account, you should also check your blog’s dashboard for alerts to these changes. Your continued use of this site after any change in this Privacy Policy will constitute your acceptance of such change.</p>
