Hi <%= name || username %>,

Congratulations on recently completing all three Free Code Camp certifications. But you have not yet finished Free Code Camp. The most important part still remains: the nonprofit projects.

These will help you contextualize and apply the raw skills you've picked up. You'll practice by building full stack JavaScript apps that real people will use. And in the end, you'll have code in production that you can showcase in your portfolio. This will be critical to your job search.

Please fill this out immediately: http://bit.ly/20VwLg0

Once you fill this out we will get back to you as quickly as possible to get you started.

Best,

Michael - nonprofit guy @ Free Code Camp
