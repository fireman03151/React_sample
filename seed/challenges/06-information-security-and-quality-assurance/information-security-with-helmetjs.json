You can configure them for each kind of resource a web page may need (scripts, stylesheets, fonts, frames, media, and so on…). There are multiple directives available, so a website owner can have a granular control. See HTML 5 Rocks, KeyCDN for more details. Unfortunately CSP in unsupported by older browser.",
