# --description--

You can use the `__name__` variable to determine if a Python script is being run as the main program or if it is being imported as a module (code written in another Python file).

If the value of `__name__` is set to `'__main__'`, it implies that the current script is the main program, and not a module.

As a final step, create an `if` statement to check if ` __name__ == '__main__'`, and move the `main()` call inside this block.

With that, the expense tracker project is complete!

# --hints--

You should have `if  __name__ == '__main__':` in your code.

```js
assert.match(code,/^if\s+__name__\s*==\s*("|')__main__\1\s*:/m);
```

Your `main()` call should be inside the `if` statement.

```js      
assert.match(code, /^if\s+__name__\s*==\s*("|')__main__\1\s*:\s*main\s*\(\s*\)/m);
```
