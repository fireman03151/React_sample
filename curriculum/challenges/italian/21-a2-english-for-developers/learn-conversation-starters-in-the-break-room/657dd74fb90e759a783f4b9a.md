# --description--

`Bookstores` are shops that sell books, and `theaters` are places where you can watch live performances or movies.

When Tom asks about places for reading and watching performances, he uses the plural forms `bookstores` and `theaters` just by adding an `s` at the end of the word. This is how you make most nouns plural in English.
