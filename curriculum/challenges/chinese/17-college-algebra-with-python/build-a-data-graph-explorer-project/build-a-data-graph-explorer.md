For this challenge, you need to create a multi-function calculator using Python that take input and do the following:

- Get a .csv file in three ways
  - uploading it from the local computer
  - getting a url from user input
  - putting the url in the code
- Use the Pandas library to save the .csv as a dataframe
- Print headings and the first two rows
- Store the column names as a list
- Choose one or two columns and convert the data to Numpy arrays
- Display data as a scatter plot or a line graph
- Be able to do this for different column combinations, and interpret the graphs

Once you're done, submit the URL to the public Colab notebook on your Google drive.
