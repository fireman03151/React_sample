# --description--

In English, the verb `sound` means to give an impression of something when heard or described. When talking about how something seems, based on what you have heard, you use `sounds` for the third person singular (it).

In the dialogue, Tom uses `sounds` after hearing Sophie's description of Maria's responsibilities. This form is correct because Tom is talking about one specific thing (Maria's role), which is considered a singular subject.

That is why he says “That `sounds` important” instead of “that `sound` important”.

# --question--

## --text--

Choose the correct sentence that uses the verb `sound` appropriately.

## --answers--

`It sounds like a good idea.`

---

`He sound very smart.`

### --feedback--

`He` is a singular subject, so the verb should be `sounds` with an `s` at the end to match the third person singular form in the present tense. The correct sentence is `He sounds very smart.`

---

`You sounds very organized.`

### --feedback--

`You` uses the base form of the verb without an `s,` even when it's singular. The correct sentence is `You sound very organized.`

---

`They sounds ready for the project.`

### --feedback--

`They` is a plural subject, and the verb should match the plural form without an `s` at the end. The correct sentence is `They sound ready for the project.`
