AUDIO REFERENCE: 
James: I can't imagine being so productive even before coming to work! 
-->

# --description--

The word `even` is used to add emphasis to a statement, often highlighting something surprising, unexpected, or extreme. 

When combined with `before` in the phrase `even before`, it emphasizes that an action or event occurs earlier than usual or expected, adding a sense of surprise or admiration. For example:

`Even before the sun rises, she starts her workout.` (emphasizes that her workout begins unusually early)

`He finished the project even before the deadline.` (implies that finishing before the deadline is surprisingly early)

In conversation, using `even` can express that something is more than what might be considered normal or usual. It makes the statement stronger.
