# --description--

Next, you are going to display the details for each expense.

Inside the `for` loop, replace `pass` with a `print()` call and pass it the following f-string: `f'Amount: {expense}, Category: {expense}'`. Leave the placeholders empty for now.

# --hints--

You should have `print(f'Amount: {expense}, Category: {expense}')` in your `for` loop.

```js
({ test: () => assert.match(code, /^\s+print\s*\(\s*f("|')Amount: \{\s*expense\s*\}, Category: \{\s*expense\s*\}\1\s*\)/m) })
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```py
def add_expense(expenses, amount, category):
    expenses.append({'amount': amount, 'category': category})
    
--fcc-editable-region--
def print_expenses(expenses):
    for expense in expenses:
        pass
--fcc-editable-region--

expenses = []
```
