<!-- (audio) Tom: Does this include brainstorming sessions?
Sophie: Occasionally, yeah. It depends on the project's needs. -->


# --description--

Remember, `occasionally` means something happens sometimes, but not regularly or often. It's less frequent than `sometimes` and more frequent than `rarely`.

Here is the adverb frequency chart from the last challenge, for your convenience.

| Adverb       | Frequency | Adverb    | Frequency |
| ------------ | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Never        | 0%        | Often     | 70%       |
| Rarely       | 5%        | Generally | 80%       |
| Seldom       | 15%       | Usually   | 90%       |
| Occasionally | 30%       | Always    | 100%      |
| Sometimes    | 50%       |           |           |

# --question--

## --text--

How often do brainstorming sessions happen according to Sophie?

At every meeting.

### --feedback--

---

Now and then.

---

Almost never.

### --feedback--

`Occasionally` is more frequent than `almost never`.

---

After every project.

### --feedback--

`After every project` would be too frequent to match `occasionally`.
