AUDIO REFERENCE:

# --question--

## --text--

What will James do if he finds problems?

## --answers--

`If he finds problems, he will take a break`

### --feedback--

This option doesn't align with the proactive approach James mentions.

---

`If he finds problems, he will report them`

### --feedback--

That's a good idea, but it's not what he says.

---

`If he finds problems, he will fix them`

---

`If he finds problems, he will ignore them`

### --feedback--

Ignoring problems contradicts the proactive and responsible approach discussed.
