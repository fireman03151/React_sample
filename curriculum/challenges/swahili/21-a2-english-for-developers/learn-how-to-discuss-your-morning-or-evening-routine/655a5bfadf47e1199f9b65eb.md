# --description--

Past tense verbs are used to talk about actions that happened in the past. Some verbs change their form in the past tense, like `say` to `said`. For example:

`Yesterday, she said she would join us` (Past tense of `say`)
`He said the meeting was at noon` (Describes a past statement about the meeting time)

Another example of irregular verb is `tell`, which becomes `told` in the past tense. For example:

`He told me about the plan last week` (Past tense of `tell`)
`Last night, they told stories about our last project` (Using `told` to describe a past action)

Don't worry if irregular verbs seem tricky; with practice, you'll get the hang of them!
