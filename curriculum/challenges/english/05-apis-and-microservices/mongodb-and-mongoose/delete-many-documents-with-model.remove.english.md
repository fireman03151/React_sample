title: Delete Many Documents with model.remove()
challengeType: 2
---

## Description
<section id='description'>
Model.remove() is useful to delete all the documents matching given criteria. Delete all the people whose name is “Mary”, using Model.remove(). Pass it to a query document with the “name” field set, and of course a callback.
Note: Model.remove() doesn’t return the deleted document, but a JSON object containing the outcome of the operation, and the number of items affected. Don’t forget to pass it to the done() callback, since we use it in tests.
