title: Perform New Updates on a Document Using model.findOneAndUpdate()
challengeType: 2
---

## Description
<section id='description'>
Recent versions of mongoose have methods to simplify documents updating. Some more advanced features (i.e. pre/post hooks, validation) behave differently with this approach, so the Classic method is still useful in many situations. findByIdAndUpdate() can be used when searching by Id.
Find a person by Name and set her age to 20. Use the function parameter personName as search key.
Hint: We want you to return the updated document. To do that you need to pass the options document { new: true } as the 3rd argument to findOneAndUpdate(). By default these methods return the unmodified object.
