title: Split Your Styles into Smaller Chunks with Partials
challengeType: 0
---

## Description
<section id='description'>
<code>Partials</code> in Sass are separate files that hold segments of CSS code. These are imported and used in other Sass files. This is a great way to group similar code into a module to keep it organized.
Names for <code>partials</code> start with the underscore (<code>_</code>) character, which tells Sass it is a small segment of CSS and not to convert it into a CSS file. Also, Sass files end with the <code>.scss</code> file extension. To bring the code in the <code>partial</code> into another Sass file, use the <code>@import</code> directive.
For example, if all your <code>mixins</code> are saved in a <code>partial</code> named "_mixins.scss", and they are needed in the "main.scss" file, this is how to use them in the main file:
<blockquote>// In the main.scss file<br><br>@import 'mixins'</blockquote>
Note that the underscore is not needed in the <code>import</code> statement - Sass understands it is a <code>partial</code>. Once a <code>partial</code> is imported into a file, all variables, <code>mixins</code>, and other code are available to use.

## Instructions

## Tests

tests:
  - text: Your code should use the <code>@import</code> directive, and should not include the underscore in the file name.
    testString: assert(code.match(/@import\s+?('|")variables\1/gi), 'Your code should use the <code>@import</code> directive, and should not include the underscore in the file name.');
