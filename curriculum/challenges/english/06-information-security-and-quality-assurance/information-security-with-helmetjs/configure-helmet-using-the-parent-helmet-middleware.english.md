## Description
<section id='description'>
As a reminder, this project is being built upon the following starter project on <a href='https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/clone-from-repo?REPO_URL=https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-infosec/'>Glitch</a>, or cloned from <a href='https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-infosec/'>GitHub</a>.
<code>app.use(helmet())</code> will automatically include all the middleware introduced above, except <code>noCache()</code>, and <code>contentSecurityPolicy()</code>, but these can be enabled if necessary. You can also disable or configure any other middleware individually, using a configuration object.
<h3>Example:</h3>

```js
app.use(helmet({
  frameguard: {         // configure
    action: 'deny'
  },
  contentSecurityPolicy: {    // enable and configure
    directives: {
      defaultSrc: ["self"],
      styleSrc: ['style.com'],
    }
  },
  dnsPrefetchControl: false     // disable
}))
```

We introduced each middleware separately for teaching purposes and for ease of testing. Using the ‘parent’ <code>helmet()</code> middleware is easy to implement in a real project.
