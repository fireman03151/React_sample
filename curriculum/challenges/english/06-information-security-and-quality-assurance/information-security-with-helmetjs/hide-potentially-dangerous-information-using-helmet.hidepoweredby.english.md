title: Hide Potentially Dangerous Information Using helmet.hidePoweredBy()
challengeType: 2

## Description
<section id='description'>
As a reminder, this project is being built upon the following starter project on <a href='https://glitch.com/#!/import/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-infosec/'>Glitch</a>, or cloned from <a href='https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-infosec/'>GitHub</a>.
Hackers can exploit known vulnerabilities in Express/Node if they see that your site is powered by Express. X-Powered-By: Express is sent in every request coming from Express by default. The helmet.hidePoweredBy() middleware will remove the X-Powered-By header. You can also explicitly set the header to something else, to throw people off. e.g. app.use(helmet.hidePoweredBy({ setTo: 'PHP 4.2.0' }))
