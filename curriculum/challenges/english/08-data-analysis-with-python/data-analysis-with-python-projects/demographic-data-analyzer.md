---

## Description
<section id='description'>
In this challenge you must analyze demographic data using Pandas. You are given a dataset of demographic data that was extracted from the 1994 Census database.

You can access <a href='https://repl.it/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-demographic-data-analyzer' target='_blank'>the full project description and starter code on Repl.it</a>.

After going to that link, fork the project. Once you complete the project based on the instructions in 'README.md', submit your project link below.

We are still developing the interactive instructional part of the data analysis with Python curriculum. For now, you will have to use other resources to learn how to pass this challenge.
