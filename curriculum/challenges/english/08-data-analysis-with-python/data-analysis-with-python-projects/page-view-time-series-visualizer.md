title: Page View Time Series Visualizer
challengeType: 10
---

## Description
<section id='description'>
For this project you will visualize time series data using a line chart, bar chart, and box plots. You will use Pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn to visualize a dataset containing the number of page views each day on the freeCodeCamp.org forum from 2016-05-09 to 2019-12-03. The data visualizations will help you understand the patterns in visits and identify yearly and monthly growth.

You can access <a href='https://repl.it/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-page-view-time-series-visualizer' target='_blank'>the full project description and starter code on Repl.it</a>.

After going to that link, fork the project. Once you complete the project based on the instructions in 'README.md', submit your project link below.

We are still developing the interactive instructional part of the data analysis with Python curriculum. For now, you will have to use other resources to learn how to pass this challenge.
