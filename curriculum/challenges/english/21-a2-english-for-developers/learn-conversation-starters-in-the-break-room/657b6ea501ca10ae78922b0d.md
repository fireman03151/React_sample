# --description--

Now that you know how to use `do` to form questions about hobbies, let's use `do` to ask about daily routines. This is useful for finding out about someone's everyday activities, which is a common topic of small talk.

Note: When you use `do` as an auxiliary verb in a question, the main verb must stay in its base form. For example:

Statement: `She works as a Full Stack dev.`

Question: `Does she work as a Full Stack dev?`

`work` stays as `work` and does not change to `works`, even when asking about a third person singular subject like `he,` `she,` or `it.`

# --question--

## --text--

Choose the question that correctly uses `do` to ask about daily activities.

## --answers--

`Do you write code every day?`

---

`Do you writes code every day?`

### --feedback--

Remember, after `do,` the main verb should not end in `s.`

---

`Writes you code every day?`

### --feedback--

The word order is incorrect in this option; `do` should be at the beginning

---

`You do write code every day?`

### --feedback--

This option uses `do` in a statement, not a question.
