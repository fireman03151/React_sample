# --description--

When you want to talk about what someone hopes to do in the future, you can use `want to` to express desire or intention. Remember that `want to` doesn't change even when talking about others.

# --question--

## --text--

Does Tom want to hear Sophie play the guitar?

## --answers--

`Yes, he wants to.`

---

`No, he doesn't want to.`

### --feedback--

The dialogue suggests Tom expresses a desire to hear Sophie play.

---

`No, he don't want to.`

### --feedback--

`Don't` is not correct with `he`; it should be `doesn't.`

`Yes, he wanted to.`

### --feedback--

`Wanted` is past tense, but Tom's desire to hear Sophie play is in the present.
