# --description--

Before you learned to ask questions using `do,` you can also use the auxiliary verb to in negative sentences. In negative sentences you combine the auxiliary verb `do` (I, you, we, they) or `does` (he, she it) with the word `not` and place it right before the main verb:

`I do not work everyday` - (Subject + do + not + main verb)

`It does not function` - (Subject + does + not + main verb)

Often, to be more practical it is common to abbreviate `do not` and `does not` to `don’t` and `doesn’t`. 

Just like with questions, when you use `don't,` the main verb that comes after it will always be in its base form, no matter who you're talking about. Remember, you use `don't` with I, you, we, and they. When you talk about he, she, or it, you will use `doesn't,` but more on that later. Right now, let's focus on using `don't.`

# --instructions--

Listen to the audio to complete the sentence below.

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Sophie: That's cool! I like photography, but I _ think of it as a hobby. I play the guitar in my free time.`

## --blanks--

`don't`

### --feedback--

Sophie is talking about what she does not do. The first blank needs `don't` to show that she does not consider photography a hobby. The second blank is the base form of the verb that describes what she does in her free time (without `don't` because it's a positive statement).
