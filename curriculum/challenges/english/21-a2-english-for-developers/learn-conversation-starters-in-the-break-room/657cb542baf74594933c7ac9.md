# --description--

When you are curious about someone's physical appearance, such as their hair color, height, or general appearance, you could use the sentence `What does (he/she) look like?`

For example: If you hear that a new programmer joined your team but you haven't met them, you can ask your colleague, `What does (he/she) look like?` 

You want to know if they are tall, have short hair, or wear glasses, so you can recognize them in the office.

**Note:** Remember that questions about a person's appearance can be sensitive. Some people may not feel comfortable discussing physical traits, and it's important to respect their feelings. Always use this question politely and in the right context, where it is appropriate to do so.
