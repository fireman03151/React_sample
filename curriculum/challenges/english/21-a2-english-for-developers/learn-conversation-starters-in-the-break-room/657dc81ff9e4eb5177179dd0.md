# --description--

`Occasionally` means something happens now and then. It is not all the time, and not never, but somewhere in between. If you occasionally get a bug in your code, it means it happens sometimes, but not too often.

Take a look at these adverbs, and the frequency they usually represent.

| Adverb       | Frequency | Adverb    | Frequency |
| ------------ | --------- | --------- | --------- |
| Never        | 0%        | Often     | 70%       |
| Rarely       | 5%        | Generally | 80%       |
| Seldom       | 15%       | Usually   | 90%       |
| Occasionally | 30%       | Always    | 100%      |
| Sometimes    | 50%       |           |           |
