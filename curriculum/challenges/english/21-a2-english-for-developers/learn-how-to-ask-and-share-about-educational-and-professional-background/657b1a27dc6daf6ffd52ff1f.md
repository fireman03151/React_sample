# --description--

In English, the noun suffixed with `'s` followed by a second noun structure is used to show possession or belonging. If the first noun is singular, as in `Sarah's laptop`, it indicates that the laptop belongs to Sarah. However, if the first noun is plural, the structure changes to noun suffixed with `'`, as in `teachers' office`, indicating an office for teachers.
