# --description--

You're already familiar with `wasn't` and `weren't` for past simple negative. Now, let's explore `didn't`, a contraction of `did not`. It's used with the base form of verbs (the infinitive without `to`) to express that an action did not happen in the past. For example, `didn't go` means the action of going did not occur.
