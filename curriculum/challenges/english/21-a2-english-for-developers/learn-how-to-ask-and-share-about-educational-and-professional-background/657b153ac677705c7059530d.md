# --description--

The phrase `could you tell me` is a polite way to ask someone for information. It's commonly used in formal or professional situations, like job interviews or meetings.
In English, some verbs have irregular past forms, meaning they do not follow the regular pattern of adding `-ed` to make the past tense. `Can` is one such verb, and its irregular simple past form is `could`. 

The existence of irregular forms, like `could`, often comes from the way language has evolved over time. These forms do not follow the regular patterns and need to be memorized. 

For example:

- Present: `I can speak English.`
- Past: `I could speak English when I was six.`
