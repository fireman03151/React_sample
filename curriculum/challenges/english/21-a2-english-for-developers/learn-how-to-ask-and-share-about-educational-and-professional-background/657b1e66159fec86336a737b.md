# --description--

You've already learned the basics of the simple past tense. Now you can dive deeper into it. Typically, the simple past tense is formed by adding `-ed` to regular verbs. For instance, the verb `play` becomes `played` in the simple past. This tense is used to describe actions that were completed at a specific time in the past.

# --question--

## --text--

What does `I played` in Sophie's sentence suggest about her experience with coding?

## --answers--

She casually experimented with coding in the past

---

She is currently playing a coding game

### --feedback--

`Played` is in the past tense, indicating a past action, not something happening currently.

---

She plans to start coding soon

### --feedback--

`Played` implies she already has some experience with coding, not that she is planning to start.

---

She never tried coding

### --feedback--

Using `played` confirms she did engage in coding, contradicting the idea of never trying it.
