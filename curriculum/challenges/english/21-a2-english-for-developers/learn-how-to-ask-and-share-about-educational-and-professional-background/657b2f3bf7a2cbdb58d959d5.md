# --description--

The word `last` is used to refer to the most recent past occurrence of a period or event. For example, `last year` means the year before this one, `last month` refers to the month before the current one, and `last week` points to the week before this week. Understanding time expressions like `last year`, `last month`, `last week`, or `last day` helps in talking about events that happened in the recent past.
