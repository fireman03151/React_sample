# --description--

The simple past tense, as reviewed earlier, is used for actions completed in the past. In this context, `we were involved in` combines the simple past tense (`were`) with the expression `involved in`, which means being a part of something, especially in an active or important role. For example, `They were involved in organizing the event` means they played an important role in organizing it.
