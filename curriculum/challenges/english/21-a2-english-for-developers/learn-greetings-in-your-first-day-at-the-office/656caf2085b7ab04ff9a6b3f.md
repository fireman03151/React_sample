# --description--

The articles `a` and `an` are both used to indicate a singular, non-specific noun. The choice between them depends on the sound that follows. If the next word begins with a consonant sound, we use `a`. If it starts with a vowel sound, we use `an`. For example:

`Quincy is a teacher at freeCodeCamp.`

The word following the article is `teacher`. As it starts with the sound of a consonant, the article `a` is the appropriate choice.

`Jake is an information security analyst.`

The word following the article is `information`. As it starts with the sound of a vowel, the article `an` is the appropriate choice.
