# --description--

Just like when you learned about the pronoun `he`, pronouns like `she` are used to refer to female individuals. They help avoid repetition in conversation. Look at this part of the dialogue:

Sophie: `Oh, c'mon, Brian!`

Brian: `But it is true. She's the person to go to if you need help!`

Here, `She` is used by Brian to refer to Sophie. Instead of repeating Sophie's name, Brian uses the pronoun `she` to make the conversation smoother and avoid redundancy.
