# --description--
Instead of saying `California is different from Texas`, Tom says: `It's different from Texas`. Tom uses `It's` as a contraction of `It` and `is`. In this context, `It` refers to `California`. 

When talking about places or things, especially when comparing or describing them, `it's` serves as a subject and verb starter for the sentence.
