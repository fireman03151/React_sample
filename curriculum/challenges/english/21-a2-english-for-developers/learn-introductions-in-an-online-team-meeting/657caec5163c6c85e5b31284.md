# --description--

`He's` can be a short form for `he has` or `he is`. You can understand which one it is by looking at the context. When `he's` is followed by a verb in the past participle (like `been`, `done`, `seen`), it means `he has`. For example:

`He's been working` means `he has been working`. 

If `he's` is followed by an adjective or a present participle (like `tired`, `going`, `sleeping`), it means `he is`. For example: 

`He's tired` means `he is tired`. Understanding this helps you know exactly what someone means when they say `he's`.
