`Mobile` means something that can be moved or used on the go, like mobile phones or tablets. An `app` is short for `application`, a type of software designed to perform a specific task. 

So, `mobile apps` are applications specifically created to run on mobile devices. These apps can do many things, like help you shop, learn a new language, or play games.
