# --description--

`Currently` comes from `current` meaning happening now. Adding `-ly` turns an adjective into an adverb. For example:

`She is currently reading a book` (She is reading a book now)

`Trends` are popular styles or ideas that many people are talking about or doing. The word `trend` in singular becomes `trends` in plural. For example:

`One current trend is using eco-friendly products` (singular)

`She writes about fashion trends` (plural)

`Tech trends` refer to popular developments in technology.
