title: Linear Regression Health Costs Calculator
challengeType: 10
---

## Description
<section id='description'>
In this challenge, you will predict healthcare costs using a regression algorithm.

You are given a dataset that contains information about different people including their healthcare costs. Use the data to predict healthcare costs based on new data.

You can access <a href='https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1o8sTSCMa8Tnmcqhp_2BKKJEaHFoFmRzI?usp=sharing' target='_blank'>the full project instructions and starter code on Google Colaboratory</a>.

After going to that link, create a copy of the notebook either in your own account or locally. Once you complete the project and it passes the test (included at that link), submit your project link below. If you are submitting a Google Colaboratory link, make sure to turn on link sharing for "anyone with the link."

We are still developing the interactive instructional content for the machine learning curriculum. For now, you can go through the video challenges in this certification. You may also have to seek out additional learning resources, similar to what you would do when working on a real-world project.
