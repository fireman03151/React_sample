title: Neural Network SMS Text Classifier
challengeType: 10
isRequired: true
---

## Description
<section id='description'>
In this challenge, you need to create a machine learning model that will classify SMS messages as either "ham" or "spam". A "ham" message is a normal message sent by a friend. A "spam" message is an advertisement or a message sent by a company.

You can access <a href='https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1qfVQwSKAKU-NKPY4ByBhr93EqSqds4dJ' target='_blank'>the full project instructions and starter code on Google Colaboratory</a>.

After going to that link, create a copy of the notebook either in your own account or locally. Once you complete the project and it passes the test (included at that link), submit your project link below. If you are submitting a Google Colaboratory link, make sure to turn on link sharing for "anyone with the link."

We are still developing the interactive instructional content for the machine learning curriculum. For now, check out these learning resources on the freeCodeCamp.org YouTube channel:
