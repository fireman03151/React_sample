title: Visualize Data with a Heat Map
challengeType: 3
forumTopicId: 301466

## Description
<section id='description'>
<strong>Objective:</strong> Build a <a href='https://codepen.io' target='_blank'>CodePen.io</a> app that is functionally similar to this: <a href='https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/JEXgeY' target='_blank'>https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/JEXgeY</a>.
Fulfill the below <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story' target='_blank'>user stories</a> and get all of the tests to pass. Give it your own personal style.
You can use HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and the D3 svg-based visualization library. Required (non-virtual) DOM elements are queried on the moment of each test. If you use a frontend framework (like Vue for example), the test results may be inaccurate for dynamic content. We hope to accommodate them eventually, but these frameworks are not currently supported for D3 projects.
<strong>User Story #1:</strong> My heat map should have a title with a corresponding <code>id="title"</code>.
<strong>User Story #2:</strong> My heat map should have a description with a corresponding <code>id="description"</code>.
<strong>User Story #3:</strong> My heat map should have an x-axis with a corresponding <code>id="x-axis"</code>.
<strong>User Story #4:</strong> My heat map should have a y-axis with a corresponding <code>id="y-axis"</code>.
<strong>User Story #5:</strong> My heat map should have <code>rect</code> elements with a <code>class="cell"</code> that represent the data.
<strong>User Story #6:</strong> There should be at least 4 different fill colors used for the cells.
<strong>User Story #7:</strong> Each cell will have the properties <code>data-month</code>, <code>data-year</code>, <code>data-temp</code> containing their corresponding month, year, and temperature values.
<strong>User Story #8:</strong> The <code>data-month</code>, <code>data-year</code> of each cell should be within the range of the data.
<strong>User Story #9:</strong> My heat map should have cells that align with the corresponding month on the y-axis.
<strong>User Story #10:</strong> My heat map should have cells that align with the corresponding year on the x-axis.
<strong>User Story #11:</strong> My heat map should have multiple tick labels on the y-axis with the full month name.
<strong>User Story #12:</strong> My heat map should have multiple tick labels on the x-axis with the years between 1754 and 2015.
<strong>User Story #13:</strong> My heat map should have a legend with a corresponding <code>id="legend"</code>.
<strong>User Story #14:</strong> My legend should contain <code>rect</code> elements.
<strong>User Story #15:</strong> The <code>rect</code> elements in the legend should use at least 4 different fill colors.
<strong>User Story #16:</strong> I can mouse over an area and see a tooltip with a corresponding <code>id="tooltip"</code> which displays more information about the area.
<strong>User Story #17:</strong> My tooltip should have a <code>data-year</code> property that corresponds to the <code>data-year</code> of the active area.
Here is the dataset you will need to complete this project: <code>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/freeCodeCamp/ProjectReferenceData/master/global-temperature.json</code>
You can build your project by forking <a href='https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/pen/MJjpwO' target='_blank'>this CodePen pen</a>. Or you can use this CDN link to run the tests in any environment you like: <code>https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/testable-projects-fcc/v1/bundle.js</code>
Once you're done, submit the URL to your working project with all its tests passing.
