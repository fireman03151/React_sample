## Description
<section id='description'>
<strong>Objective:</strong> Build a <a href='https://codepen.io' target='_blank'>CodePen.io</a> app that is functionally similar to this: <a href='https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/eZGMjp/' target='_blank'>https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/eZGMjp/</a>.
Fulfill the below <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story' target='_blank'>user stories</a>. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can see a table of the freeCodeCamp campers who've earned the most brownie points in the past 30 days.
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can see how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days, and how many they've earned total.
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can toggle between sorting the list by how many brownie points they've earned in the past 30 days and by how many brownie points they've earned total.
<strong>Hint:</strong> To get the top 100 campers for the last 30 days: <a href='https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/recent' target='_blank'>https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/recent</a>.
<strong>Hint:</strong> To get the top 100 campers of all time: <a href='https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/alltime' target='_blank'>https://fcctop100.herokuapp.com/api/fccusers/top/alltime</a>.
Remember to use <a href='http://forum.freecodecamp.org/t/how-to-get-help-when-you-are-stuck/19514' target='_blank'>Read-Search-Ask</a> if you get stuck.
