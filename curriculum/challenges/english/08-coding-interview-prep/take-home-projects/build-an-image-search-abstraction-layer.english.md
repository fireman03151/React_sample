isRequired: true
challengeType: 4
---

## Description
<section id='description'>
<strong>Objective:</strong> Build a full stack JavaScript app that allows you to search for images like this: <a href='https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/imagesearch/lolcats%20funny?offset=10' target='_blank'>https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/imagesearch/lolcats%20funny?offset=10</a> and browse recent search queries like this: <a href='https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/latest/imagesearch/' target='_blank'>https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/latest/imagesearch/</a>. Then deploy it to Glitch.
Note that for each project, you should create a new GitHub repository and a new Glitch project. If you can't remember how to do this, revisit <a href='/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects'>https://freecodecamp.org/challenges/get-set-for-our-api-development-projects</a>.
Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can get the image URLs, alt text and page urls for a set of images relating to a given search string.
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.
Once you've finished implementing these user stories, click the "I've completed this challenge" button and enter the URLs for both your GitHub repository and your live app running on Glitch.
You can get feedback on your project by sharing it with your friends on Facebook.
