title: 'Problem 147: Rectangles in cross-hatched grids'
forumTopicId: 301776
---

## Description
<section id='description'>
In a 3x2 cross-hatched grid, a total of 37 different rectangles could be situated within that grid as indicated in the sketch.

There are 5 grids smaller than 3x2, vertical and horizontal dimensions being important, i.e. 1x1, 2x1, 3x1, 1x2 and 2x2. If each of them is cross-hatched, the following number of different rectangles could be situated within those smaller grids:
1x1: 1
2x1: 4
3x1: 8
1x2: 4
2x2: 18

Adding those to the 37 of the 3x2 grid, a total of 72 different rectangles could be situated within 3x2 and smaller grids.

How many different rectangles could be situated within 47x43 and smaller grids?
