title: 'Problem 91: Right triangles with integer coordinates'
---

## Description
<section id='description'>
The points P (x1, y1) and Q (x2, y2) are plotted at integer co-ordinates and are joined to the origin, O(0,0), to form ΔOPQ.




There are exactly fourteen triangles containing a right angle that can be formed when each co-ordinate lies between 0 and 2 inclusive; that is,0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 2.




Given that 0 ≤ x1, y1, x2, y2 ≤ 50, how many right triangles can be formed?
