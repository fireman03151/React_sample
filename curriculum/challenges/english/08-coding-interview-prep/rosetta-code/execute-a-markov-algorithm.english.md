## Description
<section id='description'>
Task:
<p>Create an interpreter for a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov algorithm" title="wp: Markov algorithm">Markov Algorithm</a>.</p><p>Rules have the syntax:</p>
<p><ruleset> ::= ((<comment> | <rule>) <newline>+)*</p>
<p><comment> ::= # {<any character>}</p>
<p><rule> ::= <pattern> <whitespace> -> <whitespace> [.] <replacement></p>
<p><whitespace> ::= (<tab> | <space>) [<whitespace>]</p>
<p>There is one rule per line.</p><p>If there is a  <b>.</b>  (period)  present before the  <replacement>,  then this is a terminating rule in which case the interpreter must halt execution.</p><p>A ruleset consists of a sequence of rules, with optional comments.</p>
<p><big><big> Rulesets </big></big></p><p>Use the following tests on entries:</p>
Ruleset 1:
<pre>
This rules file is extracted from Wikipedia:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_AlgorithmA -> apple
B -> bag
S -> shop
T -> the
the shop -> my brother
a never used -> .terminating rule
</pre>
<p>Sample text of:</p>
<p> <code> I bought a B of As from T S. </code></p>
<p>Should generate the output:</p>
<p> <code> I bought a bag of apples from my brother. </code></p>
Ruleset 2:
<p>A test of the terminating rule</p>
<pre>
Slightly modified from the rules on WikipediaA -> apple
B -> bag
S -> .shop
T -> the
the shop -> my brother
a never used -> .terminating rule</pre>
<p>Sample text of:</p>
<p> <code>I bought a B of As from T S.</code></p>
<p>Should generate:</p>
<p> <code>I bought a bag of apples from T shop.</code></p>
Ruleset 3:
<p>This tests for correct substitution order and may trap simple regexp based replacement routines if special regexp characters are not escaped.</p>
<pre>
BNF Syntax testing rulesA -> apple
WWWW -> with
Bgage -> ->.*
B -> bag
->.* -> money
W -> WW
S -> .shop
T -> the
the shop -> my brother
a never used -> .terminating rule
</pre>
<p>Sample text of:</p>
<p> <code>I bought a B of As W my Bgage from T S.</code></p>
<p>Should generate:</p>
<p> <code>I bought a bag of apples with my money from T shop.</code></p>
Ruleset 4:
<p>This tests for correct order of scanning of rules, and may trap replacement routines that scan in the wrong order.  It implements a general unary multiplication engine.  (Note that the input expression must be placed within underscores in this implementation.)</p>
<pre>
## Unary Multiplication Engine, for testing Markov Algorithm implementations
## By Donal Fellows.
Unary addition engine_+1 -> _1+
1+1 -> 11+
Pass for converting from the splitting of multiplication into ordinary
addition1! -> !1
,! -> !+
_! -> _
Unary multiplication by duplicating left side, right side times1*1 -> x,@y
1x -> xX
X, -> 1,1
X1 -> 1X
_x -> _X
,x -> ,X
y1 -> 1y
y_ -> _
Next phase of applying1@1 -> x,@y
1@_ -> @_
,@_ -> !_
++ -> +
Termination cleanup for addition_1 -> 1
1+_ -> 1
_+_ ->
</pre>
<p>Sample text of:</p>
<p> <code> _1111*11111_ </code></p>
<p>should generate the output:</p>
<p> <code> 11111111111111111111 </code></p>
Ruleset 5:
<p>A simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine" title="link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine">Turing machine</a>,</p>
<p>implementing a three-state <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver" title="link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Busy_beaver">busy beaver</a>.</p><p>The tape consists of 0s and 1s,  the states are A, B, C and H (for Halt), and the head position is indicated by writing the state letter before the character where the head is.</p>
<p>All parts of the initial tape the machine operates on have to be given in the input.</p><p>Besides demonstrating that the Markov algorithm is Turing-complete, it also made me catch a bug in the C++ implementation which wasn't caught by the first four rulesets.</p>
