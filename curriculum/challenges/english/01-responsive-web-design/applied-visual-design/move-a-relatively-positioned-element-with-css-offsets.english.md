## Description
<section id='description'>
The CSS offsets of <code>top</code> or <code>bottom</code>, and <code>left</code> or <code>right</code> tell the browser how far to offset an item relative to where it would sit in the normal flow of the document. You're offsetting an element away from a given spot, which moves the element away from the referenced side (effectively, the opposite direction). As you saw in the last challenge, using the top offset moved the <code>h2</code> downwards. Likewise, using a left offset moves an item to the right.

## Tests

```yml
tests:
  - text: Your code should use a CSS offset to relatively position the <code>h2</code> 10px upwards. In other words, move it 10px away from the <code>bottom</code> of where it normally sits.
    testString: assert($('h2').css('bottom') == '10px', 'Your code should use a CSS offset to relatively position the <code>h2</code> 10px upwards. In other words, move it 10px away from the <code>bottom</code> of where it normally sits.');
  - text: Your code should use a CSS offset to relatively position the <code>h2</code> 15px towards the right. In other words, move it 15px away from the <code>left</code> of where it normally sits.
    testString: assert($('h2').css('left') == '15px', 'Your code should use a CSS offset to relatively position the <code>h2</code> 15px towards the right. In other words, move it 15px away from the <code>left</code> of where it normally sits.');
