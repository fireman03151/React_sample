## Description
<section id='description'>
Web developers traditionally use <code>lorem ipsum text</code> as placeholder text. The 'lorem ipsum' text is randomly scraped from a famous passage by Cicero of Ancient Rome.
Lorem ipsum text has been used as placeholder text by typesetters since the 16th century, and this tradition continues on the web.
Well, 5 centuries is long enough. Since we're building a CatPhotoApp, let's use something called <code>kitty ipsum text</code>.

## Instructions
