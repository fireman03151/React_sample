title: Wrap Radio Buttons in a fieldset Element for Better Accessibility

## Description
<section id='description'>
The next form topic covers accessibility of radio buttons. Each choice is given a <code>label</code> with a <code>for</code> attribute tying to the <code>id</code> of the corresponding item as covered in the last challenge. Since radio buttons often come in a group where the user must choose one, there's a way to semantically show the choices are part of a set.
The <code>fieldset</code> tag surrounds the entire grouping of radio buttons to achieve this. It often uses a <code>legend</code> tag to provide a description for the grouping, which is read by screen readers for each choice in the <code>fieldset</code> element.
The <code>fieldset</code> wrapper and <code>legend</code> tag are not necessary when the choices are self-explanatory, like a gender selection. Using a <code>label</code> with the <code>for</code> attribute for each radio button is sufficient.
Here's an example:

```html
<form>
  <fieldset>
    <legend>Choose one of these three items:</legend>
    <input id="one" type="radio" name="items" value="one">
    <label for="one">Choice One</label><br>
    <input id="two" type="radio" name="items" value="two">
    <label for="two">Choice Two</label><br>
    <input id="three" type="radio" name="items" value="three">
    <label for="three">Choice Three</label>
  </fieldset>
</form>
```

## Instructions
<section id='instructions'>
Camper Cat wants information about the ninja level of his users when they sign up for his email list. He's added a set of radio buttons and learned from our last lesson to use label tags with <code>for</code> attributes for each choice. Go Camper Cat! However, his code still needs some help. Change the <code>div</code> tag surrounding the radio buttons to a <code>fieldset</code> tag, and change the <code>p</code> tag inside it to a <code>legend</code>.

## Tests
<section id='tests'>

```yml
tests:
  - text: Your code should have a <code>fieldset</code> tag around the radio button set.
    testString: assert($('fieldset').length == 1, 'Your code should have a <code>fieldset</code> tag around the radio button set.');
  - text: Make sure your <code>fieldset</code> element has a closing tag.
    testString: assert(code.match(/<\/fieldset>/g) && code.match(/<\/fieldset>/g).length === code.match(/<fieldset>/g).length, 'Make sure your <code>fieldset</code> element has a closing tag.');
  - text: Your code should have a <code>legend</code> tag around the text asking what level ninja a user is.
    testString: assert($('legend').length == 1, 'Your code should have a <code>legend</code> tag around the text asking what level ninja a user is.');
  - text: Your code should not have any <code>div</code> tags.
    testString: assert($('div').length == 0, 'Your code should not have any <code>div</code> tags.');
  - text: Your code should no longer have a <code>p</code> tag around the text asking what level ninja a user is.
    testString: assert($('p').length == 4, 'Your code should no longer have a <code>p</code> tag around the text asking what level ninja a user is.');
