## Description
<section id='description'>
Improving accessibility with semantic HTML markup applies to using both appropriate tag names as well as attributes. The next several challenges cover some important scenarios using attributes in forms.
The <code>label</code> tag wraps the text for a specific form control item, usually the name or label for a choice. This ties meaning to the item and makes the form more readable. The <code>for</code> attribute on a <code>label</code> tag explicitly associates that <code>label</code> with the form control and is used by screen readers.
You learned about radio buttons and their labels in a lesson in the Basic HTML section. In that lesson, we wrapped the radio button input element inside a <code>label</code> element along with the label text in order to make the text clickable. Another way to achieve this is by using the <code>for</code> attribute as explained in this lesson.
The value of the <code>for</code> attribute must be the same as the value of the <code>id</code> attribute of the form control. Here's an example:

```html
<form>
  <label for="name">Name:</label>
  <input type="text" id="name" name="name">
</form>
```

## Instructions
<section id='instructions'>
Camper Cat expects a lot of interest in his thoughtful blog posts and wants to include an email sign up form. Add a <code>for</code> attribute on the email <code>label</code> that matches the <code>id</code> on its <code>input</code> field.
</section>

## Tests
<section id='tests'>

```yml
tests:
  - text: Your code should have a <code>for</code> attribute on the <code>label</code> tag that is not empty.
    testString: assert($('label').attr('for'));
  - text: Your <code>for</code> attribute value should match the <code>id</code> value on the email <code>input</code>.
    testString: assert($('label').attr('for') == 'email');

```
