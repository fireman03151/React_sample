## Description
<section id='description'>
Screen reader users have different options for what type of content their device reads. This includes skipping to (or over) landmark elements, jumping to the main content, or getting a page summary from the headings. Another option is to only hear the links available on a page.
Screen readers do this by reading the link text, or what's between the anchor (<code>a</code>) tags. Having a list of "click here" or "read more" links isn't helpful. Instead, you should use brief but descriptive text within the <code>a</code> tags to provide more meaning for these users.
</section>

## Instructions
<section id='instructions'>
The link text that Camper Cat is using is not very descriptive without the surrounding context. Move the anchor (<code>a</code>) tags so they wrap around the text "information about batteries" instead of "Click here".
</section>

## Tests
<section id='tests'>

```yml
tests:
  - text: Your code should move the anchor <code>a</code> tags from around the words "Click here" to wrap around the words "information about batteries".
    testString: assert($('a').text().match(/^(information about batteries)$/g), 'Your code should move the anchor <code>a</code> tags from around the words "Click here" to wrap around the words "information about batteries".');
  - text: Make sure your <code>a</code> element has a closing tag.
    testString: assert(code.match(/<\/a>/g) && code.match(/<\/a>/g).length === code.match(/<a href=(''|"")>/g).length, 'Make sure your <code>a</code> element has a closing tag.');
