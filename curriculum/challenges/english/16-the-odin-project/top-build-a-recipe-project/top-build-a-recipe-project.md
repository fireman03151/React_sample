assert(html && head && body);

const h2 = document.querySelectorAll('H2')[1];

assert(h2.innerText == 'Ingredients');
```

You should have an unordered list `<ul>` with some ingredients as the list items `<li>`.

```js
const unorderedList = document.querySelectorAll('UL')[0];
const listItems = document.querySelectorAll('UL > LI');

assert(unorderedList && listItems && listItems.length > 1);
```

You should have an `h2` element with the text `Steps`.

```js
const h2 = document.querySelectorAll('H2')[2];

assert(h2.innerText == 'Steps');
```

You should have a `<ol>` with the the steps as the list items `<li>`.

```js
const unorderedList = document.querySelectorAll('UL')[1];
const listItems = unorderedList.querySelectorAll('LI');

const allAreListItems = unorderedList.children.length == listItems.length;

const containsAnchors =  [...listItems].every(function(listItem) {
  return listItem.querySelector("a") !== null;
});

assert(unorderedList && allAreListItems && containsAnchors && listItems.length > 1);
```

Your anchor tags linking to the recipes should have a `href` attribute with the value set to `#`

```js
const anchorTags = document.querySelectorAll("a");

const allAnchorsHaveHrefHash = [...anchorTags].every(function(anchorTag) {
  return anchorTag.hasAttribute("href") && anchorTag.getAttribute("href") === "#";
});

assert(allAnchorsHaveHrefHash && anchorTags.length > 0); 
```
