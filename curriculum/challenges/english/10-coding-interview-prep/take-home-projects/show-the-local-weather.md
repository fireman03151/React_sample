## Description
<section id='description'>
<strong>Objective:</strong> Build a <a href='https://codepen.io' target='_blank'>CodePen.io</a> app that is functionally similar to this: <a href='https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV' target='_blank'>https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/bELRjV</a>.
<strong>Rule #1:</strong> Don't look at the example project's code. Figure it out for yourself.
<strong>Rule #2:</strong> Fulfill the below <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story' target='_blank'>user stories</a>. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can see the weather in my current location.
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather.
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit and Celsius.
<strong>Note:</strong> Many internet browsers now require an HTTP Secure (<code>https://</code>) connection to obtain a user's locale via HTML5 Geolocation. For this reason, we recommend using HTML5 Geolocation to get user location and then use the freeCodeCamp Weather API <a href='https://weather-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/' target='_blank'>https://weather-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/</a> which uses an HTTP Secure connection for the weather. Also, be sure to connect to <a href='https://codepen.io' target='_blank'>CodePen.io</a> via <code>https://</code>.
When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the "I've completed this challenge" button.
You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the <a href='https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409' target='_blank'>freeCodeCamp forum</a>.
