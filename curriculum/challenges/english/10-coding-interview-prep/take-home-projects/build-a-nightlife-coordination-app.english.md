## Description
<section id='description'>
<strong>Objective:</strong> Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: <a href='https://yoyo44.herokuapp.com/' target='_blank'>https://yoyo44.herokuapp.com/</a>.
Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:
<strong>User Story:</strong> As an unauthenticated user, I can view all bars in my area.
<strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.
<strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, I can remove myself from a bar if I no longer want to go there.
<strong>User Story:</strong> As an unauthenticated user, when I login I should not have to search again.
<strong>Hint:</strong> Try using the <a href='https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v3' target='_blank'>Yelp API</a> to find venues in the cities your users search for. If you use Yelp's API, be sure to mention so in your app.
Once you've finished implementing these user stories, enter the URL to your live app and, optionally, your GitHub repository. Then click the "I've completed this challenge" button.
You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the <a href='https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409' target='_blank'>freeCodeCamp forum</a>.
