## Description
<section id='description'>
<strong>Objective:</strong> Build a <a href='https://repl.it/' target='_blank'>Repl.it</a> app that is functionally similar to this: <a href='https://build-a-pinterest-clone.freecodecamp.rocks/' target='_blank'>https://build-a-pinterest-clone.freecodecamp.rocks/</a>.
Fulfill the below <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story' target='_blank'>user stories</a>. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
<strong>User Story:</strong> As an unauthenticated user, I can login with GitHub.
<strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, I can link to images.
<strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, I can delete images that I've linked to.
<strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, I can see a Pinterest-style wall of all the images I've linked to.
<strong>User Story:</strong> As an unauthenticated user, I can browse other users' walls of images.
<strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, if I upload an image that is broken, it will be replaced by a placeholder image. (can use jQuery broken image detection)
<strong>Hint:</strong> <a href='https://masonry.desandro.com/' target='_blank'>Masonry.js</a> is a library that allows for Pinterest-style image grids.
Once you've finished implementing these user stories, enter the URL to your live app and, optionally, your GitHub repository. Then click the "I've completed this challenge" button.
