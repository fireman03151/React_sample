## Description
<section id='description'>
<strong>Objective:</strong> Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: <a href='https://fcc-voting-arthow4n.herokuapp.com/' target='_blank'>https://fcc-voting-arthow4n.herokuapp.com/</a>.
Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:
<strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, I can keep my polls and come back later to access them.
<strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, I can share my polls with my friends.
<strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, I can see the aggregate results of my polls.
<strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, I can delete polls that I decide I don't want anymore.
<strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, I can create a poll with any number of possible items.
<strong>User Story:</strong> As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see and vote on everyone's polls.
<strong>User Story:</strong> As an unauthenticated or authenticated user, I can see the results of polls in chart form. (This could be implemented using Chart.js or Google Charts.)
<strong>User Story:</strong> As an authenticated user, if I don't like the options on a poll, I can create a new option.
Once you've finished implementing these user stories, enter the URL to your live app and, optionally, your GitHub repository. Then click the "I've completed this challenge" button.
