## Description
<section id='description'>
<strong>Objective:</strong> Build a <a href='https://codepen.io' target='_blank'>CodePen.io</a> app that is functionally similar to this: <a href='https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/' target='_blank'>https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/Myvqmo/</a>.
Fulfill the below <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_story' target='_blank'>user stories</a>. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can see whether freeCodeCamp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv.
<strong>User Story:</strong> I can click the status output and be sent directly to the freeCodeCamp's Twitch.tv channel.
<strong>User Story:</strong> if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming.
<strong>Hint:</strong> The relevant documentation about Twitch.tv's JSON API is here: <a href='https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference/#get-streams' target='_blank'>https://dev.twitch.tv/docs/api/reference/#get-streams</a>.
<strong>Hint:</strong> Here's an array of the Twitch.tv usernames of people who regularly stream: <code>["ESL_SC2", "OgamingSC2", "cretetion", "freecodecamp", "storbeck", "habathcx", "RobotCaleb", "noobs2ninjas"]</code>
<strong>UPDATE:</strong> Due to a change in conditions on API usage, Twitch.tv requires an API key, but we've built a workaround. Use <a href='https://twitch-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/' target='_blank'>https://twitch-proxy.freecodecamp.rocks/</a> instead of Twitch's API base URL (i.e. https://api.twitch.tv/helix ) and you'll still be able to get account information, without needing to sign up for an API key.
When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the "I've completed this challenge" button.
You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the <a href='https://forum.freecodecamp.org/c/project-feedback/409' target='_blank'>freeCodeCamp forum</a>.
