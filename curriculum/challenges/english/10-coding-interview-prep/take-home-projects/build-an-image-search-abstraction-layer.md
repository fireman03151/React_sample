## Description
<section id='description'>
Build a full stack JavaScript app that allows you to search for images like this: <a href='https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/imagesearch/lolcats%20funny?offset=10' target='_blank'>https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/imagesearch/lolcats%20funny?offset=10</a> and browse recent search queries like this: <a href='https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/latest/imagesearch/' target='_blank'>https://cryptic-ridge-9197.herokuapp.com/api/latest/imagesearch/</a>. Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project.
Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:
<strong>User Story:</strong> You can get the image URLs, alt text and page URLs for a set of images relating to a given search string.
<strong>User Story:</strong> You can paginate through the responses by adding a ?offset=2 parameter to the URL.
<strong>User Story:</strong> You can get a list of the most recently submitted search strings.
When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the `Solution Link` field. Optionally, also submit a link to your project's source code in the `GitHub Link` field.
