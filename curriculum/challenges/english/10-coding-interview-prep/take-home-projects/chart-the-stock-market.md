## Description
<section id='description'>
Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: <a href='https://watchstocks.herokuapp.com/' target='_blank'>https://watchstocks.herokuapp.com/</a>. Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project.
Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:
<strong>User Story:</strong> You can view a graph displaying the recent trend lines for each added stock.
<strong>User Story:</strong> You can add new stocks by their symbol name.
<strong>User Story:</strong> You can remove stocks.
<strong>User Story:</strong> You can see changes in real-time when any other user adds or removes a stock. For this you will need to use Web Sockets.
When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the `Solution Link` field. Optionally, also submit a link to your project's source code in the `GitHub Link` field.
