title: 'Problem 152: Writing one half as a sum of inverse squares'
forumTopicId: 301783

## Description
<section id='description'>
There are several ways to write the number 1/2 as a sum of inverse squares using distinct integers.
For instance, the numbers {2,3,4,5,7,12,15,20,28,35} can be used:

In fact, only using integers between 2 and 45 inclusive, there are exactly three ways to do it, the remaining two being: {2,3,4,6,7,9,10,20,28,35,36,45} and {2,3,4,6,7,9,12,15,28,30,35,36,45}.
How many ways are there to write the number 1/2 as a sum of inverse squares using distinct integers between 2 and 80 inclusive?
