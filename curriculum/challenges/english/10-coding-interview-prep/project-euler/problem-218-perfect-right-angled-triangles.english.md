title: 'Problem 218: Perfect right-angled triangles'
forumTopicId: 301860
---

## Description
<section id='description'>
Consider the right angled triangle with sides a=7, b=24 and c=25.
The area of this triangle is 84, which is divisible by the perfect numbers 6 and 28.
Moreover it is a primitive right angled triangle as gcd(a,b)=1 and gcd(b,c)=1.
Also c is a perfect square.

We will call a right angled triangle perfect if
-it is a primitive right angled triangle
-its hypotenuse is a perfect square

We will call a right angled triangle super-perfect if
-it is a perfect right angled triangle and
-its area is a multiple of the perfect numbers 6 and 28.


How many perfect right-angled triangles with câ‰¤1016 exist that are not super-perfect?
