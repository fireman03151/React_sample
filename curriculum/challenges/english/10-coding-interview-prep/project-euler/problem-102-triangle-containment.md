# --description--

Three distinct points are plotted at random on a Cartesian plane, for which -1000 ≤ x, y ≤ 1000, such that a triangle is formed.

Consider the following two triangles:

A(-340,495), B(-153,-910), C(835,-947)

X(-175,41), Y(-421,-714), Z(574,-645)

It can be verified that triangle ABC contains the origin, whereas triangle XYZ does not.

Using triangles.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 27K text file containing the coordinates of one thousand "random" triangles, find the number of triangles for which the interior contains the origin.

NOTE: The first two examples in the file represent the triangles in the example given above.

# --hints--

`euler102()` should return 228.

```js
assert.strictEqual(euler102(), 228);
```

# --seed--

## --seed-contents--

```js
function euler102() {

  return true;
}

euler102();
```

# --solutions--

```js
// solution required
```
