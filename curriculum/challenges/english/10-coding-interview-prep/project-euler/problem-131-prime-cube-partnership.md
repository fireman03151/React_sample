title: 'Problem 131: Prime cube partnership'
forumTopicId: 301759

## Description
<section id='description'>
There are some prime values, p, for which there exists a positive integer, n, such that the expression n3 + n2p is a perfect cube.
For example, when p = 19, 83 + 82Ã—19 = 123.
What is perhaps most surprising is that for each prime with this property the value of n is unique, and there are only four such primes below one-hundred.
How many primes below one million have this remarkable property?
