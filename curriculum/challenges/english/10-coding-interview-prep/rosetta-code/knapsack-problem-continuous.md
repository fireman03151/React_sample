## Description

<section id='description'>
A thief burgles a butcher's shop, where he can select from some items.
The thief knows the weights and prices of each items. Because he has a knapsack with a limit on the maximum weight that it can carry, he wants to select the items such that he would have his profit maximized. He may cut the items; the item has a reduced price after cutting that is proportional to the original price by the ratio of masses. That means: half of an item has half the price of the original.
</section>

## Instructions

<section id='instructions'>
Write a function that takes an array of objects representing the items available in the shop. Each object has 3 attributes: name, weight, and value. The function also takes the maximum weight as a parameter. The function should return the maximum value possible, and the total weight of the selected items should not exceed the maximum weight.

```js
function knapContinuous(items, maxweight) {
  function item_cmp(a, b) {
    const ua = a.unitVal,
      ub = b.unitVal;
    return ua < ub ? 1 : ua > ub ? -1 : 0;
  }
  items = items.map(({ value, weight }) => ({
    unitVal: value / weight,
    weight
  }));
  items.sort(item_cmp);

  let val = 0;
  let wt = 0;
  for (let { unitVal, weight } of items) {
    var portion = Math.min(maxweight - wt, weight);
    wt += portion;
    var addVal = portion * unitVal;
    val += addVal;
    if (wt >= maxweight) {
      break;
    }
