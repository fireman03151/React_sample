## Description
<section id='description'>
As a reminder, this project is being built upon the following starter project on <a href='https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/clone-from-repo?REPO_URL=https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-advancednode/'>Glitch</a>, or cloned from <a href='https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-advancednode/'>GitHub</a>.
Now that we can ensure the user accessing the <em>/profile</em> is authenticated, we can use the information contained in 'req.user' on our page!
Go ahead and pass the object containing the variable <em>username</em> equaling 'req.user.username' into the render method of the profile view. Then go to your 'profile.pug' view and add the line <code>h2.center#welcome Welcome, #{username}!</code> creating the h2 element with the class 'center' and id 'welcome' containing the text 'Welcome, ' and the username!
Also in the profile, add a link to <em>/logout</em>. That route will host the logic to unauthenticate a user. <code>a(href='/logout') Logout</code>
Submit your page when you think you've got it right.
