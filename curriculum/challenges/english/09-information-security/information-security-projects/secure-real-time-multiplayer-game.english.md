## Description
<section id='description'>
Develop a 2D real time multiplayer game using the HTML Canvas API and <a href='https://socket.io/' target='_blank'>Socket.io</a> that is functionally similar to this: <a href='add-glitch-url' target='_blank'>add-glitch-url</a>. 

Working on this project will involve you writing your code on Glitch on our starter project. After completing this project you can copy your public glitch url (to the homepage of your app) into this screen to test it! Optionally you may choose to write your project on another platform but it must be publicly visible for our testing.

Start this project on Glitch using <a href='https://glitch.com/edit/#!/remix/clone-from-repo?REPO_URL=add-repo-url'>this link</a> or clone <a href='add-repo-url'>this repository</a> on GitHub! If you use Glitch, remember to save the link to your project somewhere safe!

    testString: ''
  - text: The game has at least one type of collectible item. Complete the <code>Collectible</code> class in <code>Collectible.mjs</code> to implement this.
    testString: ''
  - text: At a minimum, each collectible item object created by the <code>Collectible</code> class should contain a unique <code>id</code>, a <code>value</code>, and <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates representing the item's current position.
    testString: ''
  - text: Players can use the WASD and/or arrow keys to move their avatar. Complete the <code>movePlayer</code> method in <code>Player.mjs</code> to implement this.
    testString: ''
  - text: |
      The <code>movePlayer</code> method should accept two arguments: a string of "up", "down", "left", or "right", and a number for the amount of pixels the player's position should change. <code>movePlayer</code> should adjust the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates of the player object it's called from.
    testString: ''
  - text: The player's score should be used to calculate their rank among the other players. Complete the <code>calculateRank</code> method in the <code>Player</code> class.
    testString: ''
  - text: |
      The <code>calculateRank</code> method should accept an array of objects representing all connected players and return the string <code>Rank: currentRanking/totalPlayers</code>.
    testString: ''
  - text: Players can collide with a collectible item. Complete the <code>collision</code> method in <code>Player.mjs</code> to implement this.
    testString: ''
  - text: The <code>collision</code> method should accept a collectible item's object as an argument. If the player's avatar intersects with the item, the <code>collision</code> method should return <code>true</code>.
    testString: ''
  - text: All players are kept in sync.
    testString: ''
