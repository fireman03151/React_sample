title: Catch Misspelled Variable and Function Names
challengeType: 1
---

## Description
<section id='description'>
The <code>console.log()</code> and <code>typeof</code> methods are the two primary ways to check intermediate values and types of program output. Now it's time to get into the common forms that bugs take. One syntax-level issue that fast typers can commiserate with is the humble spelling error.
Transposed, missing, or mis-capitalized characters in a variable or function name will have the browser looking for an object that doesn't exist - and complain in the form of a reference error. JavaScript variable and function names are case-sensitive.
</section>

## Instructions
<section id='instructions'>
Fix the two spelling errors in the code so the <code>netWorkingCapital</code> calculation works.
</section>

## Tests
<section id='tests'>

```yml
tests:
  - text: 'Check the spelling of the two variables used in the netWorkingCapital calculation, the console output should show that "Net working capital is: 2".'
    testString: 'assert(netWorkingCapital === 2, ''Check the spelling of the two variables used in the netWorkingCapital calculation, the console output should show that "Net working capital is: 2".'');'
  - text: There should be no instances of mis-spelled variables in the code.
    testString: assert(!code.match(/recievables/g), 'There should be no instances of mis-spelled variables in the code.');
  - text: The <code>receivables</code> variable should be declared and used properly in the code.
    testString: assert(code.match(/receivables/g).length == 2, 'The <code>receivables</code> variable should be declared and used properly in the code.');
  - text: There should be no instances of mis-spelled variables in the code.
    testString: assert(!code.match(/payable;/g), 'There should be no instances of mis-spelled variables in the code.');
  - text: The <code>payables</code> variable should be declared and used properly in the code.
    testString: assert(code.match(/payables/g).length == 2, 'The <code>payables</code> variable should be declared and used properly in the code.');
