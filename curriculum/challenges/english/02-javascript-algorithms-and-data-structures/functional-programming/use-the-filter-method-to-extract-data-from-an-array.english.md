title: Use the filter Method to Extract Data from an Array
challengeType: 1
---

## Description
<section id='description'>
Another useful array function is <code>Array.prototype.filter()</code>, or simply <code>filter()</code>. The <code>filter</code> method returns a new array which is at most as long as the original array, but usually has fewer items.
<code>Filter</code> doesn't alter the original array, just like <code>map</code>. It takes a callback function that applies the logic inside the callback on each element of the array. If an element returns true based on the criteria in the callback function, then it is included in the new array.
</section>

## Instructions
<section id='instructions'>
The variable <code>watchList</code> holds an array of objects with information on several movies. Use a combination of <code>filter</code> and <code>map</code> to return a new array of objects with only <code>title</code> and <code>rating</code> keys, but where <code>imdbRating</code> is greater than or equal to 8.0. Note that the rating values are saved as strings in the object and you may want to convert them into numbers to perform mathematical operations on them.

## Tests
<section id='tests'>

```yml
tests:
  - text: The <code>watchList</code> variable should not change.
    testString: assert(watchList[0].Title === "Inception" && watchList[4].Director == "James Cameron", 'The <code>watchList</code> variable should not change.');
  - text: Your code should use the <code>filter</code> method.
    testString: assert(code.match(/\.filter/g), 'Your code should use the <code>filter</code> method.');
  - text: Your code should not use a <code>for</code> loop.
    testString: assert(!code.match(/for\s*?\(.+?\)/g), 'Your code should not use a <code>for</code> loop.');
  - text: '<code>filteredList</code> should equal <code>[{"title": "Inception","rating": "8.8"},{"title": "Interstellar","rating": "8.6"},{"title": "The Dark Knight","rating": "9.0"},{"title": "Batman Begins","rating": "8.3"}]</code>.'
    testString: 'assert.deepEqual(filteredList, [{"title": "Inception","rating": "8.8"},{"title": "Interstellar","rating": "8.6"},{"title": "The Dark Knight","rating": "9.0"},{"title": "Batman Begins","rating": "8.3"}], ''<code>filteredList</code> should equal <code>[{"title": "Inception","rating": "8.8"},{"title": "Interstellar","rating": "8.6"},{"title": "The Dark Knight","rating": "9.0"},{"title": "Batman Begins","rating": "8.3"}]</code>.'');'
