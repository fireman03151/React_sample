title: Match All Letters and Numbers

## Description
<section id='description'>
Using character classes, you were able to search for all letters of the alphabet with <code>[a-z]</code>. This kind of character class is common enough that there is a shortcut for it, although it includes a few extra characters as well.
The closest character class in JavaScript to match the alphabet is <code>\w</code>. This shortcut is equal to <code>[A-Za-z0-9_]</code>. This character class matches upper and lowercase letters plus numbers. Note, this character class also includes the underscore character (<code>_</code>).

```js
let longHand = /[A-Za-z0-9_]+/;
let shortHand = /\w+/;
let numbers = "42";
let varNames = "important_var";
longHand.test(numbers); // Returns true
shortHand.test(numbers); // Returns true
longHand.test(varNames); // Returns true
shortHand.test(varNames); // Returns true
```

These shortcut character classes are also known as <code>shorthand character classes</code>.

tests:
  - text: Your regex should use the global flag.
    testString: assert(alphabetRegexV2.global, 'Your regex should use the global flag.');
  - text: Your regex should use the shorthand character
    testString: assert(/\\w/.test(alphabetRegexV2.source), 'Your regex should use the shorthand character <code>\w</code> to match all characters which are alphanumeric.');
  - text: Your regex should find 31 alphanumeric characters in <code>"The five boxing wizards jump quickly."</code>
    testString: assert("The five boxing wizards jump quickly.".match(alphabetRegexV2).length === 31, 'Your regex should find 31 alphanumeric characters in <code>"The five boxing wizards jump quickly."</code>');
  - text: Your regex should find 32 alphanumeric characters in <code>"Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs."</code>
    testString: assert("Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs.".match(alphabetRegexV2).length === 32, 'Your regex should find 32 alphanumeric characters in <code>"Pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs."</code>');
  - text: Your regex should find 30 alphanumeric characters in <code>"How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!"</code>
    testString: assert("How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!".match(alphabetRegexV2).length === 30, 'Your regex should find 30 alphanumeric characters in <code>"How vexingly quick daft zebras jump!"</code>');
  - text: Your regex should find 36 alphanumeric characters in <code>"123 456 7890 ABC def GHI jkl MNO pqr STU vwx YZ."</code>
    testString: assert("123 456 7890 ABC def GHI jkl MNO pqr STU vwx YZ.".match(alphabetRegexV2).length === 36, 'Your regex should find 36 alphanumeric characters in <code>"123 456 7890 ABC def GHI jkl MNO pqr STU vwx YZ."</code>');
