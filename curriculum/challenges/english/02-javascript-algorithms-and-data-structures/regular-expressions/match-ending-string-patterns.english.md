title: Match Ending String Patterns
challengeType: 1
---

## Description
<section id='description'>
In the last challenge, you learned to use the <code>caret</code> character to search for patterns at the beginning of strings. There is also a way to search for patterns at the end of strings.
You can search the end of strings using the <code>dollar sign</code> character <code>$</code> at the end of the regex.

```js
let theEnding = "This is a never ending story";
let storyRegex = /story$/;
storyRegex.test(theEnding);
// Returns true
let noEnding = "Sometimes a story will have to end";
storyRegex.test(noEnding);
// Returns false

```

</section>

## Instructions
<section id='instructions'>
Use the anchor character (<code>$</code>) to match the string <code>"caboose"</code> at the end of the string <code>caboose</code>.
</section>

## Tests
<section id='tests'>

```yml
tests:
  - text: You should search for <code>"caboose"</code> with the dollar sign <code>$</code> anchor in your regex.
    testString: assert(lastRegex.source == "caboose$", 'You should search for <code>"caboose"</code> with the dollar sign <code>$</code> anchor in your regex.');
  - text: Your regex should not use any flags.
    testString: assert(lastRegex.flags == "", 'Your regex should not use any flags.');
  - text: You should match <code>"caboose"</code> at the end of the string <code>"The last car on a train is the caboose"</code>
    testString: assert(lastRegex.test("The last car on a train is the caboose"), 'You should match <code>"caboose"</code> at the end of the string <code>"The last car on a train is the caboose"</code>');
