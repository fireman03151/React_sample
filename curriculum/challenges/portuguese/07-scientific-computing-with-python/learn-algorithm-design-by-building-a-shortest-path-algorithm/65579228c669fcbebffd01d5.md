# --description--

The other bug is subtle. When a shorter distance is found for a neighbor node, `paths[current]` gets assigned to the neighbor node path, `paths[node]`. 

This means both variables point to the same list. Since lists are mutable, when you append the neighbor node to its path, both `paths[node]` and `paths[current]` are modified because they are the same list. This results in wrong paths, although the distances are correct.

Fix that bug by assigning a copy of `paths[current]` to the neighbor node path. Modify the existing assignment inside your `if` block.

# --hints--

You should use the slice syntax to assign a copy of `paths[current]` to the neighbor node path.

```js
({ test: () => assert.match(code, /^(\s*)if\s+paths\s*\[\s*node\s*\]\s+and\s+paths\s*\[\s*node\s*\]\s*\[\s*-\s*1\s*\]\s*==\s*node\s*:\s*^\1\s{4}paths\s*\[\s*node\s*\]\s*=\s*paths\s*\[\s*current\s*\]\s*\[\s*::?\s*\]/ms) })
```
