# --description--

`Readers` are people who read, especially those who read a particular publication.

To `experiment` means to try new ideas or methods. 

An `interview` is a conversation where someone asks questions to get information. 

An `infographic` is a visual image like a chart or diagram used to represent information. For example:

`We experiment with new teaching methods` (trying new ideas)

`The journalist conducts interviews with her readers` (conversation for information)

`They use infographics to explain data` (visual images for information)
