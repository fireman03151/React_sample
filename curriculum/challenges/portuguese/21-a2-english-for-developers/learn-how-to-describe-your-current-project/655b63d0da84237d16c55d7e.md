# --description--

The word `might` is used to express possibility or uncertainty. It's similar to `may` but often implies a lower probability. For example:

`I might go to the park` 

It means there's a possibility of going to the park, but it's not certain. 

In James's sentence, `might` suggests that there are possible problems he's looking for, but he's not sure yet.
