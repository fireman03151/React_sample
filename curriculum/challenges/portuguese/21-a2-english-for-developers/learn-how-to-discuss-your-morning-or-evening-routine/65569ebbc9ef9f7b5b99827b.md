# --description--

`Look` can refer to both the action of seeing and to someone's appearance. For example, `You look great!` is about appearance, not looking at a place. 

It's important to be careful when commenting on someone's appearance, as it can be sensitive. 

Use such comments only with people you know well and in an appropriate context. 

Other examples include `You look tired`, or `You look excited`.
