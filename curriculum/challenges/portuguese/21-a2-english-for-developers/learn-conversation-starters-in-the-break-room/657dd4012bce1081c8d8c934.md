<!-- Tom: How about restaurants? Are there any good restaurants in this neighborhood? -->

# --description--

The word `any` is often used in questions to ask if something exists or is available, without specifying a quantity. It's useful when you don't know if there is something or how much there is and you want to find out.

For example: `Are there any updates?` 

The word `any` is used to ask if there are updates without specifying a number. 

`Any` is often used in questions and negative statements to mean `some` or `even a little.` Here's how you might use it in different contexts:

- In questions: `Do you have any questions?` (It doesn't matter if there are many questions or just one; you're asking if there are questions at all.)
- In negative sentences: `I don't have any money.` (I have zero money.)
- With offers and requests: `Could I have any of these cookies?` (It doesn't matter which cookie; any cookie will do.)
