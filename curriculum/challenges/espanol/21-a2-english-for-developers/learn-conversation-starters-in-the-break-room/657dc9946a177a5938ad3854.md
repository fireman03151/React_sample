<!-- (audio) Sophie: Occasionally, yeah. It depends on the project's needs. -->

# --description--

`It depends on` is used to say that the answer to a question can change based on different things. For example:

How long it takes to make a website depends on how big or small the job is.
Choosing the coding language depends on the computer or system we use.

Notice that after `depends` thereâ€™s always the preposition `on`. 

# --instructions--
