AUDIO REFERENCE:Â 
(audio) Sarah: Hey, James! Thanks. Look, I don't do anything out of the ordinary, I think. I usually wake up around 7 AM. The first thing I do is stretch a bit to wake up. Then, I go straight to the kitchen to make a cup of coffee. It's my morning fuel!

# --description--

`Ordinary` means normal or usual. Something ordinary is not special or different. For example:

`Eating cereal for breakfast is ordinary`

`Out of the ordinary` means something unusual or not common. For example, if your friend usually takes the bus to school but one day arrives in a limousine, that's out of the ordinary. It's not common or usual for them.
