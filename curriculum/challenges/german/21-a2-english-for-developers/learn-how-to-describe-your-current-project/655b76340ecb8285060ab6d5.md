AUDIO REFERENCE:
James: Hi Sophie! I'm checking our network for problems. We want to be safe from hackers. I'm using special tools to see where we might have problems, and then I have to fix them.
Sophie: That's important work. I'm helping our team learn how to stay safe online. We're taking some lessons and practicing what to do if someone tries to steal our identity.
