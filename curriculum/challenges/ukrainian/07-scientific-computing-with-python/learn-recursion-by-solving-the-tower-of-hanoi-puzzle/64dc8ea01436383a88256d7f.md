# --description--

The puzzle starts with the disks piled up on the first rod, in decreasing size. You need to populate your first list with numbers representing the various disk sizes.

Instead of adding the items manually to the first list, generate a sequence of numbers from `3` to `1` by using the `range()` function and assign it to `rods['A']`.

The syntax is `range(x, y, h)`, where `x` is the starting integer (inclusive), `y` is the last integer (not inclusive), and `h` is the difference between a number and the next one in the sequence.

# --hints--

You should use the `range()` function to assign a sequence of numbers to `rods['A']`. The syntax for calling the `range()` function is `range(x, y, h)`.

```js
({ test: () => assert(__pyodide.runPython(`
  a = __locals.get('rods')
  type(a['A']) is range
  `))
})
```

You should use the `range()` function to assign the sequence of numbers from `3` to `1` to `rods['A']`.

```js
({ test: () => assert(__pyodide.runPython(`
 a = __locals.get('rods')
 a['A'] == range(3, 0, -1)
  `))
})
```
