AUDIO REFERENCE: 
Sarah: Hi Bob! I'm looking at customer data to find patterns. We're trying to understand what our customers like and what they buy. We are not having any luck at the moment.

# --description--

Present continuous is used for actions happening at the moment of speaking. For example:

`We're being successful with our marketing campaign` (Notice how the verb `to be` was conjugated as `being` to demonstrate that this is true at the present moment).

Present continuous can be used in negative forms to express that something is not happening. For example:

`I'm not working today` (negative form)

`They're not finding any solutions` (negative form)

`To be successful with something` means achieving an objective.
