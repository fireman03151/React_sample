# --description--

Regular verbs usually add `-ed` to form the past tense.

`Complicated` is the past tense form of the regular verb `complicate`, meaning something is not simple or easy to do. Here are some other examples with regular verbs:

`I walked to the store` (Past tense of `walk`)

`She cleaned her room yesterday` (Past tense of `clean`)

Extra note to help with the audio:

`Running around` means moving about in a hurried or energetic way, often chaotically. For example:

`The kids are running around the playground`
