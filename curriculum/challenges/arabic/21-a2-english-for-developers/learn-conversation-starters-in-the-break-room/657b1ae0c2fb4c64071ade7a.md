# --description--

When you want to ask about something specific, you can use the question word `what`. `What` is commonly used to talk about things. 

You usually put `what` at the beginning of a question. Then you follow it with the verb `to be` (like `is` or `are`) or other verbs, and then the subject (like `you` or `the team`). 

For example: `What is your name?` or `What are they doing?`
