# --description--

You will be <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-cat-and-dog-image-classifier/blob/master/fcc_cat_dog.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">working on this project with Google Colaboratory</a>.

After going to that link, create a copy of the notebook either in your own account or locally. Once you complete the project and it passes the test (included at that link), submit your project link below. If you are submitting a Google Colaboratory link, make sure to turn on link sharing for "anyone with the link."

# --instructions--

For this challenge, you need to create a multi-function calculator using Python that take input and do the following:

- Get a .csv file in three ways
  - uploading it from the local computer
  - getting a url from user input
  - putting the url in the code
- Use the Pandas library to save the .csv as a dataframe
- Print headings and the first two rows
- Store the column names as a list
- Choose one or two columns and convert the data to Numpy arrays
- Display data as a scatter plot or a line graph
- Be able to do this for different column combinations, and interpret the graphs

Once you're done, submit the URL to the public Colab notebook on your Google drive.
