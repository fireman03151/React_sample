# --description--

You will be <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-cat-and-dog-image-classifier/blob/master/fcc_cat_dog.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">working on this project with Google Colaboratory</a>.

After going to that link, create a copy of the notebook either in your own account or locally. Once you complete the project and it passes the test (included at that link), submit your project link below. If you are submitting a Google Colaboratory link, make sure to turn on link sharing for "anyone with the link."

# --instructions--

For this challenge, you need to create three math games using Python that do the following:

- Scatter plot game
  - Randomly generate points on a graph and the player has to input the (x,y) coordinates
  - For added difficulty, make the graph larger
- Algebra practice game
  - Generate one-step and two-step problems with random integer values and the player has to input the answer
  - Use positive and negative values. For added difficulty, make the numbers larger
- Projectile game
  - Display a "wall" with random height and location. Player has to move sliders to adjust a parabolic path to clear the wall
  - For added difficulty, make a second level where players enter a, b, and c without sliders

Once you're done, submit the URL to the public Colab notebook on your Google drive.
