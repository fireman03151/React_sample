# --description--

`Busy` means having a lot to do; being actively involved in something. 

For example, `She's busy with her project.`

`By the way` is used to introduce a new topic or ask a question that's not directly related to the current conversation. It's like saying, "Oh, I just thought of something else." 

For example, `By the way, have you seen the new blog feature?`
