# --description--

So far, you've exercised how to ask questions with `do` and make negative sentences with `don't.`
Let's review them. Remember:

Affirmative: `I do work on weekends.` (means the person works on weekends)
Negative: `I don't work on weekends.` (means the person does not work on weekends)

# --instructions--

Read the dialogue excerpt and fill in the blanks using `do` or `don't.`

# --fillInTheBlank--

## --sentence--

`Sophie: Hey, Tom! I saw you taking lots of pics with your cell phone outside the building. Are you into photography?`

`Tom: Yes, but I'm only practicing. I love it. How about you? _ you have any hobbies?`

`Sophie: That's cool! I like it, but I _ think of it as a hobby. I play the guitar in my free time.`
