# --description--

`Sure` means to be confident or certain about something. 

When you add the suffix `-ly`, `sure` becomes an adverb, `surely`, which means doing something in a certain or confident way. 

It's often used to emphasize what the speaker believes is true or likely to be true. For example:

`Surely, you can see why this is important` (emphasizing that the importance is expected to be clear)

`She will surely finish the project on time` (showing confidence in her completing the project)
