# --description--

There's a difference between `may be` and `maybe`. Let's take a closer look. 

`May` on its own also suggests possibility or permission. `May be` suggests a possibility or potentiality. 

`Maybe` is an adverb indicating uncertainty or possibility. For example:

`It may be raining outside.` (suggests a possibility of rain)
`Maybe I will go out later.` (expresses uncertainty about going out)
`May I ask a question?` (Asks for the permission to speak)
