# --description--

Build a full stack JavaScript app that is functionally similar to this: <a href="https://yoyo44.herokuapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://yoyo44.herokuapp.com/</a>. Use a site builder of your choice to complete the project.

Here are the specific user stories you should implement for this project:

**User Story:** As an unauthenticated user, you can view all bars in your area.

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, you can add yourself to a bar to indicate you are going there tonight.

**User Story:** As an authenticated user, you can remove yourself from a bar if you no longer want to go there.

**用戶故事：** 作爲未經身份驗證的用戶，當我登錄時，我不需要再次搜索。

**Hint:** Try using the Yelp API to find venues in the cities your users search for. 如果使用 Yelp 的 API，請務必在應用中提及。

When you are done, make sure a working demo of your project is hosted somewhere public. Then submit the URL to it in the Solution Link field. Optionally, also submit a link to your project's source code in the GitHub Link field.
