      "By the end of this process, we'll be good at coding. We'll have a portfolio of apps with happy users to prove it. We'll also have an alumni network of fellow coders and nonprofits ready to serve as references.",

      "Also, for every pure coding job, there are at least 5 additional jobs that require some coding skills. So even if you decide not to pursue coding as a career, you'll still walk away with a valuable job skill.",
