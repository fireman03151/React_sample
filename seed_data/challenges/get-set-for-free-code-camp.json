        "All our challenges are <ol><li>free</li><li>self-paced</li><li>browser-based</li></ol>",
        "We'll spend <ol><li>200 hours learning tools like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js and databases</li><li>600 hours building practice projects</li><li>800 hours building full stack solutions for nonprofits</li></ol>",
        "By the end, we'll <ol><li>be good at coding</li><li>have the portfolio of apps with happy users to prove it</li></ol>",
        "Once you make it through Free Code Camp, you will be able to get a coding job. There are far more job openings out there than there are qualified coders to fill them.",
