Welcome to freeCodeCamp's open source codebase and curriculum!
=======================

freeCodeCamp is a friendly open source community where you learn to code and help nonprofits.

**We help our campers build job-worthy portfolios of real apps used by real people, while helping nonprofits.**

You start by working through our self-paced, browser-based full stack JavaScript curriculum.

### By working through our curriculum, you can earn four certifications:
##### 1. Front End Certification
The first section will teach you the basics of how webpages work and also introduce you to JavaScript programming.

Skills you'll practice include `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `jQuery` and `Bootstrap`.

To earn this certification, you'll build **10 front-end projects** and implement many **JavaScript algorithms**.

##### 2. Data Visualization Certification
The second section builds upon the first and introduces you to more advanced topics such as `Sass`, `React` and `D3`.

To earn this certification, you'll build **5 React-apps** and **5 Data visualization apps** using `D3.js`.

##### 3. Back End Certification
The third section introduces you to back end development using `Node.js`, `Express,` and `MongoDB`. It also teaches you about the important concept of source control using `Git`.

To earn this certification, you'll build **5 APIs** and **5 full stack apps**.

We will accept solutions implemented in _any_ programming language, as long as both a live demo and the source code are publicly accessible.

##### 4. Full Stack Certification
The fourth section is where you'll get **real-world experience** by working on projects for **nonprofits**.
We'll pair you with another camper, an agile project manager, and a stakeholder from a nonprofit organization. Together, you'll plan, build and maintain apps that help that nonprofit carry out its mission more effectively.

For this certification, you'll work on **two projects from scratch** and then **maintain/upgrade two existing projects**.
