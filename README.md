Hackathon Starter [![Dependency Status](https://david-dm.org/sahat/hackathon-starter.png?theme=shields.io)](https://david-dm.org/sahat/hackathon-starter)
=================
A boilerplate for **Node.js** web applications.

**Live Demo**: http://hackathonstarter.herokuapp.com :octocat:

If you have attended any hackathons in the past then you know how much time it takes to
get a project started. Decide on an idea, pick a programming language, pick a web framework,
pick a CSS framework. A while later, you will have an initial project up on GitHub, and only then can other team members
start contributing. Or what about doing something as simple as OAuth 2.0 Authentication? You can spend hours
on it if you are not familiar with how OAuth 2.0 works. *(As a side-note, over a year ago
I had no idea WTF REST or OAuth were, or how to do a simple "Sign in with Facebook".
It was a frustrating experience to say the least.)*

When I started this project, my primary focus was on **simplicity** and **ease of use**.
I also tried to make it as **generic** and **reusable** as possible to cover most use cases of hackathon web apps,
without being too specific. In the worst case you can use this as a guide for your projects, if for example you are only
interested in **Sign in with Google** authentication and nothing else.

Chances are, you might not need all 4 types of OAuth 1.0a/OAuth2 authentication methods, or all 9 API examples.
Sadly, there is no step-by-step wizard to configure the boilerplate code just for your use case. So, use what you need, simply delete what you don't need.

Prerequisites
-------------
- MongoDB
- Node.js
- Command Line Tools
 - **Mac OS X**: [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12) (or **OS X 10.9 Mavericks**: `xcode-select --install`)
 - **Windows**: [Visual Studio](http://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/download-visual-studio-vs#d-express-windows-8)
 - **Ubuntu**: `sudo apt-get install build-essential`
 - **Fedora**: `sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools"`
 - **OpenSUSE**: `sudo zypper install --type pattern devel_basis`

:exclamation: **Note**: If you are new to Node.js or Express framework,
I highly recommend watching [Node.js and Express 101](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN0JlMZCtNU) screencast that teaches Node and Express from scratch.


Getting Started
---------------

The easiest way to get started is to clone the repository:

```bash
# Fetch only the latest commits.
git clone --depth=1 git@github.com:sahat/hackathon-starter.git my-project

cd my-project

# Install NPM dependencies
npm install

node app.js
```

>:exclamation: **Note**: I strongly recommend installing nodemon `sudo npm install -g nodemon`.
>It will monitor for any changes in your node.js
>application and automatically restart the server. Once installed, instead of `node app.js` use `nodemon app.js`.
>It is a big time saver in the long run.

Next up, if you want to use any of the APIs or OAuth authentication methods, you will need to obtain
appropriate credentials: Client ID, Client Secret, API Key, or Username & Password. You will
need to go through each provider to generate new credentials.

Project Structure
-----------------

| Name          | Description   |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| **config**/passport.js      | Passport Local and OAuth strategies + Passport middleware. |
| **config**/secrets.js    | Your API keys, tokens, passwords and database URL.      |
| **controllers**/api.js | Controller for /api route and all api examples.      |
| **controllers**/contact.js | Controller for contact form.      |
| **controllers**/home.js | Controller for home page (index).
| **controllers**/user.js | Controller for user account management page.      |
| **models**/User.js | Mongoose schema and model for User.      |
| **public/*** | Static assets, i.e. fonts, css, js, img.   |
| **views/account/*** | Templates relating to user account.     |
| **views/api/*** | Templates relating to API Examples.   |
| **views**/layout.jade | Base template.     |
| **views**/home.jade | Home page template.     |


:exclamation: **Note:** There is no difference how you name or structure your views. You could place all your templates in a top-level `views` directory without having a nested folder structure, if that makes things easier for you. Just don't forget to update `extends ../layout`  and corresponding `res.render()` method in controllers. For smaller apps, I find having a flat folder structure to be easier to work with.

:exclamation: **Note 2:** Although your main template - **layout.jade** only knows about `/css/styles.css` file, you should be editing **styles.less** stylesheet. Express will automatically generate **styles.css** whenever there are changes in LESS file. This is done via [less-middleware](https://github.com/emberfeather/less.js-middleware) node.js library.

FAQ
---
### Why Jade and not Handlebars template engine?
When I first created this project I didn't have any experience with Handlebars. Since then I have worked on Ember.js apps and got myself familiar with the Handlebars syntax. While it is true Handlebars is easier, because it looks like good old HTML, I have no regrets picking Jade over Handlebars. First off, it's the default template engine in Express, so someone who has built Express apps in the past already knows it. Secondly, I find `extends` and `block` to be indispensable, which as far as I know, Handlebars does not have out of the box. And lastly, subjectively speaking, Jade looks much cleaner and shorter than Handlebars, or any non-HAML style for that matter.

### Why do you have all routes defined in app.js?
For the sake of simplicity. While there might be a better approach, such as passing `app` context to each controller as outlined in this [blog](http://timstermatic.github.io/blog/2013/08/17/a-simple-mvc-framework-with-node-and-express/), I find such style to be confusing for beginners. It took me a long time to grasp the concept of `exports` and `module.exports`, let alone having a global `app` reference in other files. That to me is a backward thinking. The `app.js` is the "center of the universe", it should be the one referencing models, routes, controllers, etc. When working solo I actually prefer to have everything in `app.js` as is the case with this REST API server for [ember-sass-express-starter's app.js file](https://github.com/sahat/ember-sass-express-starter/blob/master/app.js). That makes things so much simpler!

### I don't need a sticky footer, can I delete it?
Absolutely. But unlike a regular footer there is a bit more work involved. First, delete `#wrap` and `#footer` ID selectors from **styles.less**. Next, delete `#wrap` and `#footer` lines from **layout.jade** (By the way, If no element is specified before the class or id, Jade assumes it's a `div` element). Don't forget to indent everything under `#wrap` to the left once, since this project uses two spaces per block indentation.

### Can I use Ember, Angular or Backbone with Hackathon Starter?
It might be possible, but why would you want to?
I specifically avoided client-side MV* frameworks in this project to keep things simple.
There is a big shift in the way you develop apps with Ember, Backbone, Angular
as opposed to server-side frameworks like Express, Flask, Rails, Django. Not only
would you need to know how to use Express in this case, but also the client-side framework of your choice,
which in itself is not a trivial task. It's best if you use a boilerplate of choice for your particular
client-side framework and just grab the pieces you need from the Hackathon Starter.

TODO
----
- Concatenate and minify all assets via Express middleware if possible, otherwise Gulp.js. Because even with caching enabled, there is at least 50-80ms delay for each static file request (On Heroku).
- Pages that require login, should automatically redirect to last attempted URL on successful sign-in.
- Add more API examples.
- Mocha tests.
