Welcome to Free Code Camp's open source codebase and curriculum!
=======================

Free Code Camp is an open-source community where you learn to code and help nonprofits.

You start by working through our self-paced, browser-based full stack JavaScript curriculum. 

After you complete the first 400 hours worth of challenges (which involves building 10 single-page apps), you'll earn your Front End Development Certification.

After you complete the second 400 hours worth of challenges (which involves building and deploying 5 full stack apps), you'll earn your Full Stack Development Certification.

Then we'll pair you with another camper, an agile project manager, and a stakeholder from a nonprofit organization. Together, you'll plan and build an app that helps that nonprofit carry out its mission more effectively.

**We help our campers build job-worthy portfolios of real apps used by real people, while helping nonprofits.**

This code is running live at [FreeCodeCamp.com](http://www.FreeCodeCamp.com). We also have [Gitter](https://gitter.im/FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp), a [Medium publication](http://medium.freecodecamp.com), and even a [Twitch.tv channel](http://twitch.tv/freecodecamp).
