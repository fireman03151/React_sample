Hackathon Starter
=================
A kickstarter for **Node.js** web applications. 

When I started this project, my primary focus was on **simplicity** and **ease of use**. Anyone who knows a little bit of JavaScript should be able to get started without too much pain. I tried to make it as **generic** and **reusable** as possible to cover most use cases of hackathon web apps, without being too specific.

Chances are, you will not need all 4 types of OAuth2 authentication methods, or all 9 API Browser examples. Sadly, there is no step-by-step wizzard to configure the boilerplate code just for your use case. So, use what you need, simply delete what you don't need.
